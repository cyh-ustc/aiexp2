above to learn more about the equipment nbsp nbsp the industry forum issue forum members dik m pa it would be much more useful to the industry if spfa would help find a code conforming fire barrier for attics crawl spaces etc than nbsp lecture on fast and loose applications of code nbsp something about cents a bd ft installed meeting all codes and spray applied many companies we talk to have a product that appears to be perfect but they haven t spent the money to test over foam maybe a small committee could do a evaluation of various products report results to spfa who in turn will acquire funding from us nbsp william b australia we are in australia but we are finding it hard to locate polyurea sprayers here so that we can start a chapter of the pda do u have any list of australian contractors suppliers or maybe they can put their hand up and lets us know at enviroline powerup com au nbsp it is nbsp for the better nbsp of the game that an association is need to inform clients and specifiers of the uses and properties of polyureas and train its own members also to keep cowboys out that give the industry a bad name nbsp ed m i am a writer for aviation magazines and one that i write for is a test international a new publication that just launched this month i need any new processes you might have that would be used on aircraft particularly commercial aviation nbsp john c louisiana i have a foam cat graco machine and a probler gun with a tip nbsp i use this setup to spray truck bed liners nbsp my question is can i and how do i spray foam insulation using my equipment nbsp and what are the different types of insulation nbsp murph mahaffey glas craft i like the new look of the industry forum nbsp mark w south carolina i m sick of all this garbage about covering foam with a thermal barrier what the hell do you think foam is if you are saying that anything that can be forced to burn should be covered with a fireproof barrier then you d better get busy covering all those trusses and joists and plywood up there that are definitely not carrying a class one fire rating this double standard for foam is coming directly from those who stand to lose business from it icynene is different nbsp it doesn t burn alone it doesn t melt it doesn t emit phosgene does it smoke in a fire situation sure so what blaming foam in the attic for a house fire because it forces the foam to eventually burn is about as stupid as blaming foam seat cushions for burning when a gas tank ruptures and burns up a car get real inspectors you want us to cover up the only thing in the attic assembly that doesn t burn nbsp as for the vaunted r rating system it is totally bogus the test is designed to make porous insulations appear to perform better than they actually do nbsp measuring only conduction and ignoring convection and radiant to convective transfer the test should have been thrown out for the industry lackey it is years ago along with that obsolete fiberglassgarbage they re still selling everybody nbsp there s a reason they don t make refrigerators freezers coolers amp coffee cups out of fiberglass or cellulose nbsp nbsp think about it nbsp dirk benthien forum moderator thank you mark and dik for your statements above i also feel that far too often individuals and companies are too complacent and quietly live with rules and regulations without trying to
