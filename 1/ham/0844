 anyone heard of this law before back when i was running the wsmf shoutcast server these restrictions were just being placed on netcasters most folks laughed it off now with the license fees its not laughable anymore if you pay the fee you are bound to the restrictions if you dont your running the criminal line i still run a stream up on live its been playing the same hour block of jean shepard shows for the last year i really should change them up if i were going to do the old wsmf shoutcast now adays i would either spend lots of time going over regulations to see what i can or cannot do or i would just chuck the regs out and do what i want or i might write some apps to stay in regs i dont know one thing is for sure it defiently takes the spontaneous edge off things f murray abraham f scott fitzgerald f hillary rossen tom
