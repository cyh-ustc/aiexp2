 barry here s an interesting thing to test discriminate words differently if they are on a line that starts with or to catch styles like above that the first occurance on a line of is to eliminate html give me a mod to timtoken py that does this and i ll be happy to test it then again it may not be worth trying to un false positive that nigerian scam quote if there s any sanity in the world even the original poster would be glad to have his kneejerk response blocked otoh you know there are a great many msgs on c l py all over usenet that do nothing except quote a previous post and add a one line comment remove the quoted sections from those and there may be no content left to judge except for the headers so i can see this nudging the stats in either direction the only way to find out for sure is for you to write some code
