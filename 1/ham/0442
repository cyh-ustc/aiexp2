 exmh p content type text plain charset us ascii from robert elz date thu aug date wed aug from chris garrigues message id i can t reproduce this error ah i think i just found the cause nmh is broken which is probably obvious from my previous mail the man page for pick and how it always used to work was that list would list messages matched nolist would supress that if sequence is given the default is nolist without sequence the default is list that s all fine but it appears now which probably means i had never used pick since i upgraded nmh last that what counts is the order of list and sequence that is if sequence comes after list the list gets turned off sequence implies nolist instead of just making nolist the default an easy workaround for this is to make sure that list is the last arg given to pick so if i run delta pick inbox lbrace lbrace subject ftp rbrace rbrace sequence mercury list which is just as it should be hmmm i assume you re going to report this to the nmh folks chris chris garrigues http www deepeddy com cwg vircio http www vircio com congress suite austin tx world war iii the wrong doers vs the evil doers exmh p content type application pgp signature begin pgp signature version gnupg v gnu linux comment exmh version id dbqe zp lk b h r iuirahsfaj dwespjzxda q t yyullxbp ryacfuf d ltpgx kxywpbhgv buhy gy h ck end pgp signature exmh p exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
