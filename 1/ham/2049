 url http www joelonsoftware com news html date not supplied daniel berlinger has noticed that mac software shops are starting to move to os x only development this makes sense for two reasons first most people who pay for software have new computers so while os x may only have a small fraction of the installed base it has the majority of the population of people who are opening their wallets second if os x isn t successful the mac is over it s not like system is getting any more popular then again there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right business decision to develop software for the macintosh developing for the mac is not a whole lot different than creating a web site that only works on netscape given the market share of macs about and the market share of netscape about that is not a silly comparison robb beal wrote try this test go to a venture firm angel or big company with a mac os x product concept prototype do they consider the fact that it s a mac application a net plus no well duh your product would have to appeal to times more mac users as a percentage than windows users just to break even in other words if your windows product appeals to in windows users you have to appeal to in mac users to make the same amount of money now you may want to make an emotional appeal to developing for the mac that s fine if you like macs and you re doing it for fun more power to ya but as long as we re talking investment you have to tell me why you re going to get times as many users maybe there s less competition in your category on the mac maybe you re in a niche like graphics where it seems like macs dominate they don t it just seems that way because the elite graphics people in big american cities use macs maybe your product can t sell to mixed environments unless it runs everywhere but if you want to make an investment in mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you re going to overcome that magic multiplier http archipelago phrasewise com http maccentral macworld com news marketshare php http websidestory com cgi bin wss cgi corporate news press http radio weblogs com html
