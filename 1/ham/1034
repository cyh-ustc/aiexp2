 date mon aug from chris garrigues message id tell me what keystroke made it happen so i can reproduce it and i ll see what i can do about it or if i can t i ll hand it off to brent don t worry too much about it you seem to have plenty of other things to do in the immediate future and this one isn t so critical that people can t use the code in normal ways but to make it happen type with normal key bindings any digit so the code thinks you re trying a message number then backspace so the digit goes away then other junk characters don t seem to have the problem i have just been playing that will do it every time that is h once you get into that state the same traceback occurs for every character you type until a message is selected with the mouse this is looking like it might be easy to find and fix so i ll take a look at it later kre exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
