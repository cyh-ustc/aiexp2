 james this is not an exmh problem but an interaction between sendmail james solaris and mh correct james your sysadmin is wrong it is the responsibility of the receiving mail james server to escape lines beginning with from if they choose to turn james on that facility it is not the responsibility for email clients to james cater to the stupid design of the unix mail spool and sun s even more james stupid decision to rely on content length instead of dealing with james this problem since mh is unaware of content length rcvstore gags james trying to parse messages from the spool also correct in fairness though i cannot defend the content length header as i consider it brain damage in the extreme sun inherited this from at t james get your mail administrator to add the e flag to your sendmail james this means you will never see a line beginning with from any such james line will look like from specifically you will need to find a line in etc mail sendmail cf that starts with mlocal such as grep mlocal etc mail sendmail cf mlocal p usr lib mail local f lsdfmaw qpsxfmnz e s envfromsmtp hdrfroml r envtol hdrtol and make sure that e appears in the long list of flags following f if your sys admin uses m to generate sendmail cf and any good sys admin should then here is the magic line for the mc file modify mailer flags local e dnl james you can learn to use procmail invoking rcvstore directly instead of james letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool this avoids james the whole issue rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time james and everything works also correct though procmail per se is not needed as other filters such as slocal which is part of the n mh distribution do the trick just as well john exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
