 matthias saou wrote ok i ll add this cool requiring a file that isn t part of an rpm is not possible no except maybe by stopping the build process if it isn t found but that s errr ugly and i really think that for people who installed a kernel from sources the easiest is to install the alsa kernel drivers from source too yes it is but then alsa driver requires alsa kernel and i don t quite like nodeps this would be a tricky one since to use the with feature of rpmbuild i think you d need to add individual handling of each and every card that s ok i was only considering it for the sake of tweaking anyway not for some real world need that s what the alsa driver is there for create all the base files excluding the kernel drivers what i would suggest for dependency reasons it to install an alsa kernel for the original kernel you ve kept it right and install alsa modules from source for custom kernels built from source um i keep for emergency sitations like i forget to include keyboard support in kernel dumb me but alsa kernel does not require kernel so that s ok matthias silent and on the seventh day god was arrested for tresspassing rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
