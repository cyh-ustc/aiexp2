 j for anyone to fully bury global warming they would need to j explain why the dramatic increase in co concentrations are not j increasing the global temperature you have not explained why the increase in co concentrations is not contributing to increasing global temperature this too was not news to the theoreticians all that has happened is that nasa has confirmed the naiive convection concerns precisely which theoreticians do you mean what exactly do you mean by a global warming theoretician scientists in this area don t use that term i assure you that not all scientists performing modeling of global temperature phenomena agree with your assertions jim
