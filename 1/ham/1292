 once upon a time ralf wrote matthias saou wrote my main concern is that when rebuilding the recent packages i ve made for psyche on valhalla i d need to lower the release tag to keep an upgrade working and that would f ck up my cvs repository which is on my valhalla box sorry i don t get it what s wrong with a release tag of fr say you have installed synaptic fr on your valhalla box package rebuilt for valhalla then you upgrade to psyche using the red hat cds hopefully with the compat libraries the package will still be there although i doubt that since c is binary incompatible so this is probably a bad example then you apt get update with the new psyche repository and there s where the problem will be it will say that there are two synaptic fr packages one installed the other available with the same version but different dependencies that s why i always keep package versions lower for older distributions matthias matthias saou world trade center edificio norte planta system and network engineer barcelona spain electronic group interactive phone rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
