 in addition one bit of anecdotal evidence from a conversation in in san fransisco is hardly enough to extrapolate to k this is the only quote i could find relating to promiscuity in homosexual men i think people feel a certain invulnerability especially young people like this disease doesn t affect me the publicity about the disease was very much the kind where it was easy to say that isn t me i m not promiscuous promiscuity especially was a piece where people could easily say well i m not promiscuous is more than i do if you have partners a year you can think you re not promiscuous if you know somebody who has so it s all relative and it was easy to feel that that isn t me you could find hets who have the same kind of partner volume bfd this kind of random generation of numbers that leads the nutty religious bigots as you mentioned earlier grr bits damnit now i must go brief bb el on sun sep cdale wrote i agree w ya tom that kind of thinking is so idiotic sure gays el so how many of your hetero friends had k lovers bmn so eugen how many of your homo friends have had k lovers bmn in fact thats a general question for fork proper bmn do you know anyone outside of meybee wilt chamberlin and a few of the bmn gang bang porn queens who have had even k lovers bmn eegads if you re hypothesizing numbers like that eugen you at bmn least owe it to fork to back that shit up bmn otherwise we re liable to assume rampant unfounded homophobia and that bmn would just be a lose bmn just a quick assumption here i m not a math geek or anything but bmn assuming lover every day that would be like at least one lover bmn everyday for years and some change i don t know about you but bmn very very few of us are that lucky or even close to that lucky bmn and after awhile even the sexaholics get bored and have to mingle bmn something new into their weekends you really are assumiing that the bmn homosexual population is a that large in a given area the meccas bmn might qualify but try finding that kind of homosexual population in bmn say tulsa oklahoma or manchester nh tho manchester does have quite bmn a few nifty gaybars but thats a different story b that bored sex bmn obsessed recreationally free to pursue sex that often with that many bmn partners or that they d even want that many partners bmn qualify yourself or at least lower your outrageous numbers bmn bb are promiscuous and so are hets but i betcha gays are more aidsphobic than hets generally speaking el the virus load issue is orthogonal to the fact bzzt switch on your el brain you both i was mentioning that a subpopulation outside of the sex el industry is used to be extremely promiscuous about two orders of el magnitude higher than average best regards bitbitch mailto bitbitch magnesium net
