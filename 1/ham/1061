 on mon sep pdt rick baartman wrote sorry i wasn t clear i am transferring messages from my inbox to other folders and since i am doing it from most recent to oldest they appear in those folders in the wrong order and need re sorting ok gotcha i don t think you can do that with exmh but you can do it on the command line if you use sh or ksh for f in folders fast r do echo sorting f sortm f done it could take a long time at work i have to use outlook ick i hate it but it does a few things right like making indices for each folder and not just by date but also by sender message size subject so i can sort by any column instantly i believe this is possible too with an imap compliant reader provided the imap server makes such indices i am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry standards i use it for my personal mail my mail server runs unix and i connect over ssh and tunnel my x traffic over ssh with a slow link this makes exmh very slow and mime handling is pretty bad compared with modern mailers i am just scared to move i ve been using mh or nmh since and exmh since years is a long time exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
