 gw greg ward writes gw if you and guido barry et al prefer i could change that gw last statement to folder none so the mail won t be saved gw at all i don t care if the mail is foldered on python org but personal messages regardless of who they re for shouldn t be part of the public spambayes repository unless specifically approved by both the recipient and sender note also that we are much more liberal about python org zope org mailing list traffic than most folks read list managers for any length of time and you ll find that there are a lot of people who assert strict copyright over their collections are very protective of their traffic and got really pissed when gmane just started gatewaying their messages without asking which might be an appropriate for their lists but not for ours don t think i m suggesting we do the same i like our laissez faire approach but for personal email we should be more careful barry
