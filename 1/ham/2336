 url http www joelonsoftware com news html date not supplied i ve been snowed under for the last four weeks working on the fogbugz setup program for various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits wise installshield windows installer could do even of what our setup program needed to do so i ended up writing it from scratch vc and mfc all the way it took longer than i expected because i had this weird conviction that the entire setup process should be completely reversable and as you go backwards through the wizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already made so even if you re looking at the last screen if you decide you want to change where to extract the files you can just back up and change it and everything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the windows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted are ungranted and the sql database you made is unmade and so on the end result is a great setup program but it may be a tad overkill if i have time i ll write more about what i learned one benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that i don t have to have someone else s stupid cartoon of a computer and floppy disks in the upper right hand corner i used a photograph of the london skyline currently infested with cranes i took the picture from the cafe at the tate modern img http www joelonsoftware com pictures fbsetup jpg fogbugz setup
