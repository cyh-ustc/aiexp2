 on thu sep at pm darragh wrote the help that i received today then though i tried to build them i started by trying the w program i used the following lines which produced some strange results would any one be able to set me straight configure with emacs prefix usr local src beta w exec prefix usr local src beta w with url url url one thing i think you might be doing slightly wrong is your specification of prefixes prefix is the directory to be used as root for installing files typically packages use usr local as default so binaries might then go in usr local bin documentation in usr local doc and so forth normally i find it sufficient to put prefix usr local and do not further specify things like exec prefix maybe you have a special reason for using the prefixes you chose in which case ignore me that worked fine so i moved to the next step make at the bottem of the text i got the following messages cannot open load file url url url vars el make custom load el error make leaving directory usr local src beta w lisp make w error when i got around to trying the url package i had no problems in saying that this doesn t necessarily mean that i was doing it right so below are the commands i used configure with emacs prefix url url exec prefix url url i d make the same remarks about prefixes here i would use the command configure with emacs prefix usr local to get w to compile i think the with url flag you should use is with url usr local share emacs site lisp assuming you compiled installed url with prefix usr local since you appear to have installed url in url url configure w with configure with emacs prefix usr local with url url url share emacs site lisp a command you would have found useful would have been find name url vars el print which would have told you where the url vars el file was installed a program which is very useful is checkinstall http asic linux com mx izto checkinstall it allows you to install packages from source while still registering them in the package management system of your distro rpm deb tgz instead of make install type checkinstall and a package is put together and installed for you makes uninstallation simpler than it might otherwise be michael conry ph web http www acronymchile com key fingerprint b c a cb b de c irish linux users group ilug linux ie http www linux ie mailman listinfo ilug for un subscription information list maintainer listmaster linux ie
