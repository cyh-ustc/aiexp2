 r russell turpin writes r things aren t all that bad i remember vancouver as having a r broad variety of good local eateries and toronto as having a r variety of good local strip joints i haven t been to van in years but i do know that in toronto outside of the small deeply ethnic neighbourhoods if you stray more than feet from wellesley and jarvis or queen and spadina you re in doughnutland there s far more like the eateries in the eaton centre than there are quaint cafes like mccaul north of dundas and the rare little eateries are not brimming with lunchtime traffic you can still find a seat at noon at village by the grange when most of toronto does not live in those neighbourhoods but instead lives in scarborough malton mississauga and markham franchisevilles you will quickly see that one or two trendy strips does not save an entire nation gary lawrence murphy teledynamics communications inc business advantage through community software http www teledyn com computers are useless they can only give you answers pablo picasso
