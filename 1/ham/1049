 chris garrigues said from brent welch date wed aug well i ve used the check the modify time cache trick for files in many places not just exmh so some part of me certainly thinks it is effective however it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint state then aren t we modifying the sequences file for the current folder on every message read perhaps we look at the sequences file more than once per message view as i d written the code a few months ago we were reading the sequences file first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence this happens anywhere that we look at sequences most notably in ftoc showsequences that seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise but i wanted my abstraction to have a separate call for what sequences are in this folder and what messages are in this sequence one option would have been to add another call to get the data off of disk but i felt that the check the modify time technique would be less error prone i like the check the modify time technique i think the biggest gains would be from augmenting ftoc showsequences to allow a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the current code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences for all messages i described these thoughts in an email message yesterday and again if it can wait a few weeks i m willing to do it ok i ve yet to dive into the latest round of changes but i plan to i can say i ll make any progress but i may dabble thanks again for all your work in this area generalized sequence support has been on my to do list for about years brent welch software architect panasas inc pioneering the world s most scalable and agile storage network www panasas com welch panasas com exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
