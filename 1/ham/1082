 i run exmh on my desktops at home and at work with the resulting exmh windows being displayed on both my work and home desktops gratis ssh x forwarding in fact your message was read and replied to this message while at work using an exmh instance running on my home machine just to throw in another approach to solving the same problem i run two copies of exmh one at work one at home they both display on a virtual x server created by vncserver on the home box i connect to that virtual x server using vncviewer wherever i happen to be the vnc connection is tunneled over ssh and is carried over the internet via an ipsec appliance that gives me access to both home and work email from either place without the complications involved in having two copies of exmh working on the same set of folders it s a tad slow viewing work email when i m at work but not so bad that i can t stand it hal exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
