 jeremy hylton the total collections are messages i trained with messages i m reading this now as that you trained on about spam and about ham that s less than of the sizes of the training sets i ve been using please try an experiment train on of each and test once against the other of each do that a few times making a random split each time it won t be long until you discover why directories of individual files are a lot easier to work e g random shuffle makes this kind of thing trivial for me
