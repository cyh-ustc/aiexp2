 matt kettler said ok first the important stuff happy birthday justin a lil late but oh well cheers a miss ratio on the spam corpus at seems awfully high although that nice low fp percentage is quite nice as is the narrow in of average fp fn scores compared to as dan said it s a hard corpus made harder without the spamtrap data also and this is an important point those measurements can t be directly compared because i changed the methodology in the scores were evolved on the entire corpus then evaluated using that corpus ie there was no blind testing and the scores could overfit and still provide good statistics in they re evaluated blind on a totally unseen set of messages so those figures would be a lot more accurate for real world use j
