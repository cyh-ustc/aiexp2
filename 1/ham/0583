 bitbitch writes listen if you pull numbers like that without a fact the automagic assumption is yes they were extracted out of your neither orifice point wasn t to conclude otherwise unless you had any relevant bits its not my job to do your bit searching for you but i figured i d humor fork with this bit of finding http www thebody com bp apr research notebook html pointing ot averages of about for every months for gay men which totals to about a year a year doesn t equal or even er that study would seem to lend credence to eugen s estimations rather than casting fresh doubts a year does exceed in under years time the average age of that study s participants was meaning some participants may have had years of active sex life at that age and further hiv it seems reasonable to think that some the participants may have actually slowed their pace a bit so while this study s summary info is incomplete you could easily conclude that the average participant in this one study will have had over a thousand partners over a year active sex life and so the even more active tails of the distribution could easily be in the range of course this says very little almost nothing about the overall population behavior gay or straight and the relative prevalence of k individuals in either group but it does strongly suggest that gay males with k partners exist in measurable numbers so people should stop treating eugen s anecdotal estimation as if it were sheer fantasy bitbitch s own citation suggests otherwise gordon
