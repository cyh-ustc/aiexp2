 robert harley gordon mohr wrote definitional nit to pick you ve redefined promiscuity above as total or average activity i think it s clear that i m talking about averages so i m not sure why that nit needs to be picked it was clear you were talking about averages but it should be equally clear that that isn t what people mean when they use the word promiscuity which seems to rob it of its common meaning activity above some specific threshold usually one in that case promiscous is a vacuous term in modern western societies but we knew that where people average partners or so in their adult lives not at all there are still people who only have one partner there are many more whoe only have one partner over long periods of time so it is far from vacuous to describe some people as promiscuous and others as not promiscuous especially over a set period he was promiscuous in college he is no longer promiscuous the word has a clear meaning despite your continuing tendency to gloss that meaning over with population averages consider a population of males and females so in this contrived population females are more promiscuous than males so girl gets guy girls get guys guys get girl guy gets girls sounds like six of one versus half a dozen of the other to me ok then consider a population of men each pair off with women then man let s call him wilt also has sex with the other women women have had more than one partner men have only had one partner it is now perfectly obvious that in the common meaning of the term among this contrived population that women are more promiscuous than men even though the single most promiscuous person wilt is a man promiscuity is not exactly perfectly identical between males and females except under a degenerate custom definition of promiscuity unless promiscuity is defined uselessly ain t nothin useless about averages averages are useful sure but much more so if called by their actual name rather than conflated with another concept gordon
