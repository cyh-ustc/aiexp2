 begin pgp signed message hash sha i know it s not the popular choice for a lot of people but i d suggest um church like woody allen said of life is showing up right almost anyone can find a church where the sermons don t make you bust out laughing and you re set i for instance am a unitarian which as someone once observed is merely a decompression chamber between a real church and a golf course obuujokes mid s bumper sticker honk if you re not sure lenny bruce did you hear about how the klan burned a question mark on the unitarian s lawn unitarians would rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven itself unitarians pray to whom it may concern etc but seriously folks my teenage adopted denomination i m um lapsed on several fronts a dutch reformed turned atheist father and an agnostic mother who used to be a southern baptist of some stripe or another and frankly limousine liberal secular humanist congregation is about as orthogonal to my present congenital republican small l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist politics as it is possible to be except for the secular humanist bit and i still go pretty regularly though not as much as i used to heck the older i get the less of the divine i believe in i m asymptotically approaching my father s atheism these days and i show up at least once a month nice folks though when i can keep a civil tongue in my head smart too when i can t and end up arguing with them anyway if i can end up hitched anyone can talk about orthogonal i met my practically socialist state education bureaucrat wife one year after i started moved in with her weeks later married her years after that and i wasn t even trying meet women i was just looking to make friends as i was new in town the trick to the church thing is whatever denomination congregation you end up in expect to end up with a mate not a date i mean some guys manage to stay single but most like me don t you can practically see the laser sights light up when you walk into a room that s because of course most churches are run by women most regular attendants are women hell of all new ministers in protestant denominations at least are women no matter your age looks intelligence whatever you ll end up surrounded by women you ll be outnumbered even several to one some of whom are at least better looking than you are the only place where there are more women running things is in grass roots republican politics but i won t go there i promise if i may make a presumption here since you brought it up i figure that between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent s religions and the ubiquity of indians in various stages of assimilation in so nocal you can find some place to hang out near you rohit you probably don t even have to go um native like i did backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing and becoming horrors a unitarian cheers rah begin pgp signature version pgp iqa awubpyjcbcpxh jf ohaeqi vwcbb ukmyii xwkqvvjfswlmmrhebsamwub jdmfqrnrqed lmw v yutn vq a end pgp signature r a hettinga the internet bearer underwriting corporation farquhar street boston ma usa however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity predicting the end of the world has not been found agreeable to experience edward gibbon decline and fall of the roman empire
