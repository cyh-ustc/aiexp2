 ok iknow this is blatantly ot but i m beginning to go insane had an old dell dimension xps sitting in the corner and decided to put it to use i know it was working pre being stuck in the corner but when i plugged it in hit the power nothing happened i opened her up and had a look and say nothing much a little orange led comes on when i plug her in but that s it after some googling i found some reference to re seating all the parts but no change the problem i m having is that since the power supply is some dell specific one atx block with what looks like one of the old at power connectors i cant figure out weather this is a mobo prob or a psu prob just to futily try and drag this back ot i want to install linux on it when i get it working if anyone knows what the problem might be give me a shout ie if you are getting a little orange led when you plug it in then your psu is probably working irish linux users group ilug linux ie http www linux ie mailman listinfo ilug for un subscription information list maintainer listmaster linux ie
