 date wed sep from brent welch message id exmh has a funky cut paste model that is essentially all my fault the middle click sets the insert point if you hate that go to the bindings simple edit preferences window and de select paste sets insert unfortunately the side effect of that solution is that it is no longer possible to cut paste within one sedit window some intermediate client always must be used except in the rare case where you want to select some text and then paste it at the same place that s because the click that you have to with this option make to set the insert point also kills the selection it ends up reverting to the last selection made in some other window or something like that so the vast majority of people probably want that paste sets insert enabled that one you can learn to live with the other is much more painful kre exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
