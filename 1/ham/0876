 gab the problem is that politics have gotten so muddied gab nowadays that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting gab political rallies that you don t agree with has become gab common practice the courts have constantly ruled gab that there are some restrictions on the first amendment gab they teach you that your very first year of law school i ll agree with owen on this one muddied my ass how hard is it to chose between a republocrat or a demipublican not very shouting down has grown to become the answer because the government over a span of years and with the help of the courts has limited the rights we have as citizens under the first amendment wishful thinking people are just bigger dickheads now culture is changing and it is becoming acceptable to get in peoples face and shout them down when you disagree with them the people that do this are not disenfranchised they get their rocks off on being disagreeable assholes the act of protesting is more important than the actual issue being protested for most of these people question the policy about terrorism or drugs or iraq or bush in general you re aiding terrorism if you challenge the beliefs of the folks attending the various shadowy g conferences you re an anarchist and you re herded off to a designated protest spot miles away from anything part of the point of speech is to be heard i can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere and while thats speech its not effective speech people are screaming and shouting over the political figures because they cannot be heard in any other way and where does this end shouting down speakers is an obviously stupid tactic if they are really interested in advocating change are they such clueless social morons that they don t see this or are they just interested in stroking their pathetic egos obtw clueless social moron syndrom does not have political boundaries bill
