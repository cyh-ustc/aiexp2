 would someone please enlighten me on dependencies pre requisites for installation in freebsd the official documentation isn t particularly explicit about this stuff eg procmail is mentioned but without saying whether or not its essential no info provided on whether gnumake is required or if standard bsd make is ok i thought we were quite good about it in the readme file procmail is essential if you re using a spamassassin for local delivery b not using a milter and c not using a mail audit script instead so probably yes bsd make is ok if perl generally uses it to build perl modules spamassassin is just anotehr perl module in that respect back to this stuff again searched high low but definitely nothing on this system even vaguely resembling a readme file for spamassassin i have procmail installed but having major problems comprehending the setup would appreciate info on any simple english howto
