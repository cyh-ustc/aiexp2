 on sat oct at pm padraig brady mentioned ok i m upgrading vorbis on my machine and i m getting the following rpm u libvorbis vorbis tools i rpm error failed dependencies libvorbisfile so is needed by sdl mixer libvorbisfile so is needed by xmms libvorbisfile so is needed by tuxracer this is because the new libvorbis rpm only has libvorbisfile so so is this a problem in the other packages depending on a specific version libvorbisfile so rather than on the generic libvorbis so this is a pain the only way you can resolve this to my knowledge is to download the original libvorbis rpm and the new one remove the old one then do rpm uvh libvorbis rpm then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time and does so why you can t do this after you have one library already installed is beyond me kate irish linux users group ilug linux ie http www linux ie mailman listinfo ilug for un subscription information list maintainer listmaster linux ie
