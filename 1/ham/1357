 once upon a time ville wrote btw i think i ll kake it so that my ogle package automatically inserts this options ide cd dma to etc modules conf it currently creates the dev dvd link to dev cdrom which will work most of the time if there s only one drive if no dev dvd exists eek maybe it s just me but i don t think that s a good idea outputting a message in post and providing a readme of some kind would be better as well as perhaps adding a note in description why eek if no dev dvd exists it ll create it if dev dvd exists it won t touch it if someone installs ogle a dvd player i m assuming the hardware is recent enough for software playback and that the drive is a dvd rom all of them support dma but since that change requires a reboot or a manual change i m still hesitating to integrate it my goal is to allow users to install a dvd player through synaptic and play dvds in no time outputting a message in the post section of a package is always a bad idea putting the tip in the description sounds good though matthias clean custom red hat linux rpm packages http freshrpms net red hat linux release valhalla running linux kernel acpi load rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
