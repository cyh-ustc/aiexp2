 on sep rosso wrote john waylan who was interviewed in wired a few years back pulled out a second run in the quarter mile mph on a battery pack that hasn t been broken in yet he expects to break his record next year topping his sec mph run a couple of years ago he s shooting for a second run battery pack huh what you dont use batteries for a mile run you use capacitors many times the energy density and you can get the energy out fast enough note that the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run anyway just like a gas dragster is refueled so this wouldnt be cheating mph should be no problem adam l duncan beberg http www mithral com beberg beberg mithral com
