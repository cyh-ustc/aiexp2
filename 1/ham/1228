 i apologize for not catching up to the current code in so long now that i have i m trying to resolve breakage and differences the unseen window seems to have been replaced with the sequences window while i appreciate the flexibility of the sequences window the unseen window filled an important to me need it was tiny and could be set to show on all desktops of a virtual window manager without taking a lot of space since my normal mode of operation involves two copies of exmh displaying on a x vnc session screen space is at a premium as things stand now i have a sequences window that shows a lot more information than i need to have handy and takes up a lot more room than i can spare i can see that i could like the new sequences window a lot for certain operations but i d like a nice uncluttered tiny window that only shows me info on my unread mail one possibility that occurs to me would be a button or mouse click that shrinks the sequences window to show only the sequences in the always show list and of course a way to expand it back hal exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
