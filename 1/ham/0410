 on wed at gary lawrence murphy wrote and a java program due to the extensive class libraries will weigh in at the number of lines of the equivalent c program qed my typical java to c conversion doesn t increase the lines of code by more than and a fair portion of that is the implementation of additional features that drove us to do the conversion in the first place some things are substantially more succinct when written in c than in java c and most other mature languages have an endless collection of libraries i personally don t use anything beyond the core libraries of any language that much though on a tangent i find libraries nearly useless for a great many things due primarily to the fact that most of them are so general that a given non trivial api almost always has a context in which it will function in a pathological manner code reuse is wonderful and all that but libraries frequently make design trade offs that won t work for me even if they theoretically do exactly what i need unfortunately it isn t particularly easy nor does it make a nice simple api to design a library that really is optimizable to a wide range of design cases i ve built a small collection of flexible psuedo polymorphic apis over the years that i tend to use but it is a pretty ugly solution for code reuse when you get right down to it james rogers jamesr best com
