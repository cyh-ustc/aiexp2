 oh well uh thank you russell lol i think c on sat sep russell turpin wrote robert harley it is perfectly obvious that heterosexual promiscuity is exactly precisely identical between males and females yeah assuming approximately equal populations but that obscures the different modes of promiscuity both the person who gives sex for money or power or companionship and the person who uses money and power and companionship to get sex are promiscuous in the broadest sense of the word but their motives and behavior are quite different langur monkeys were the example in the cited article dominant males kill babies that are not their own the dominant male monkey seeks to defend his harem of females but cozying up to the current dominant male isn t the best strategy for female langurs because dominant males are dethroned by rivals every months or so by mating with as many extra group males as possible female langurs ensure their offspring against infanticide by the male who is likely next to rule the roost maybe it s just me but that doesn t paint a picture of carefree females engaged in joyously promiscuous couplings the dom cab driver who is taking her two boy toys to new orleans is a better picture of that chat with friends online try msn messenger http messenger msn com i don t take no stocks in mathematics anyway huckleberry finn
