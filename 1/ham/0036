 in a message dated thu aug cdt ulises ponce said thanks tony but i think doing it using component files will get a signature by default but i have many diferent signatures and i want to insert one of that signatures using a keyboard command so for a message i will insert a signature but for another message i will insert a different signature is it possible i am using sedit for my messages ahm if you don t object to using a mouse for such things exmh has the ability to insert different sigs on demand create a bunch of different sig files all beginning with signature and at start up exmh will load them all in the sedit window you ll see a sign menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed signature files for that e mail you can actually use several if you d like though i don t remember what preferences option allows for this however the signature gets added on send not inserted directly into the existing sedit window prior to composition i currently have different sig files i can choose between additionally if a signature file has the execute bit turned on exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the script as your signature i hope this helps some seeya paul it may look like i m just sitting here doing nothing but i m really actively waiting for all my problems to go away if you re not having fun you re not doing it right exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
