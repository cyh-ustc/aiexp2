 dan kohn writes guys the habeas infringers list hil exists explicitly to deal with spammers while we re getting judgments against them and especially in other countries where those judgments are harder to get my concern doesn t stem from failing to understand how your business is intended to work my concern is the lack of empirical evidence that it will reduce the amount of uncaught spam please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers yes some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes and isps have won some theft of service suits but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles so i can t understand how daniel can assert that you can t track spammers down when it s never really been tried please don t misquote me i did not assert that you can t track spammers here is what i said it will be difficult to find prosecute and win money from someone in various non friendly countries where spam originates china is a good example even if they do officially respect copyright law i understand the incentive that you have to pursue spammers but that does not directly translate to less spam being sent to my inbox it is an indirect effect and the magnitude of the effect may not be sufficient to counteract the ease with which a score on the mark allows spam to avoid being tagged as spam daniel it s easy enough for you to change the habeas scores yourself on your installation if habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to non spammers and to place all violators on the hil then i have no doubt that justin and craig will quickly remove us from the next release but you re trying to kill habeas before it has a chance to show any promise i think i ve worked on sa enough to understand that i can localize a score i m just not comfortable with using spamassassin as a vehicle for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base i think it would make more sense to start habeas with a less aggressive score one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyone s inbox and after we ve seen evidence that the system works then we can increase the magnitude of the score dan this sf net email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven http thinkgeek com sf spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk lists sourceforge net https lists sourceforge net lists listinfo spamassassin talk
