 bart schaefer said this is off the topic of the rest of this discussion but amavisd in all its incarnations and mimedefang and several other mta plugins all reject at smtp time messages that scores higher than some threshold often argh they do not do they the fps must be just gigantic if some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than there d better be zero fps because all those filters would drop their thresholds to well my point is more that we should aim our rescoring algorithm so that a spam hits any higher does us no good as it means an fp is a lot harder to recover from using compensation rules spams will hit higher than that that s just the way the scoring works but for our code to be effective and spread the range of scores correctly we just have to optimise to hit threshold j this sf net email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven http thinkgeek com sf spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk lists sourceforge net https lists sourceforge net lists listinfo spamassassin talk
