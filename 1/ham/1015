 hardware acceleration for ssl makes sense since pki can slow down a transaction by as much as fold per this article xml formatting only increases doc size by about fold i m not sure there are enough powers of ten in there to justify hardware acceleration expect the next major release from datapower to be the revolutionary new email chip allows you to offload the sending and receiving of email messages onto dedicated hardware while you get on w more important things like listening to mp s best paul sholtz original message from rohit khare to fork example com sent pm subject datapower announces xml in silicon no analysis yet don t know what to make of it yet but here s the raw bits for all to peruse and check out what s really going on best rohit datapower delivers xml acceleration device by scott tyler shafer august am pt datapower technology on monday unveiled its network device designed specifically to process xml data unlike competing solutions that process xml data in software datapower s device processes the data in hardware a technology achievement that provides greater performance according to company officials the new device dubbed datapower xa xml accelerator is the first in a family of products expected from the cambridge mass based startup the datapower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology called xg that does the analysis parsing and processing of the xml data according to steve kelly ceo of datapower the xa accelerator was conceived to meet the steady adoption of xml the anticipated future proliferation of web services and as a means to share data between two businesses our vision is to build out an xml aware infrastructure kelly said the xa is the first of a family kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up to times this he said makes processing the data very taxing on application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best alternative in addition to the large file sizes security is also of paramount importance in the world of xml today s firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only kelly said a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall firewalls are blind to xml today future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on security especially as web services proliferate kelly said according to datapower most existing solutions to offload xml processing are homegrown and done in software an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security after trying the software path the company turned to creating a solution that would process xml in hardware our xg execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do xml processing claims that he believes will be mostly false other content aware switches such as ssl secure socket layer accelerators and load balancers look at the first bytes of a packet while the xa provides deeper packet inspection looking at bytes and thus enabling greater processing of xml data kelly explained the u high network device has been tested against a large collection of xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device the xa can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are xml kelly said in addition to proxy mode the device can also be used as an application co processor this deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market startup sarvega based in burr ridge ill introduced the sarvega xpe switch in may and earlier this month tarari an intel spin off launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration the datapower device is now available priced starting at the company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises datapower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was founded in early by eugene kuznetsov a technology visionary who foresaw the adverse effects xml and other next generation protocols would have on enterprise networks long before industry interest in xml grew kuznetsov assembled a team of world class m i t engineers and designed the industry s first solutions to address the unique requirements for processing xml the first such solution was a software interpreter called dgxt this software based approach to xml processing is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from developing software based accelerators kuznetsov s team raised the bar and designed a system for processing xml in purpose built hardware in datapower s effort produced xml generation three xg the industry s fastest technology for xml processing bar none today xg technology powers the industry s first wire speed xml network devices enabling secure high speed applications and xml web services while other companies are just now marketing first versions of products datapower is delivering its third generation of technology providing an immediate return on technology investments to industry leading customers and partners

joined datapower s board of directors datapower will use this funding to accelerate development marketing and sales of the company s breakthrough technology for xml aware networking founded in datapower invented the world s first intelligent xml networking devices capable of transforming xml traffic and transactions at the wire speed enterprises need to effectively embrace web services and other xml centric initiatives datapower s solutions are based on its patent pending xml generation three xg technology enterprises are adopting xml at rapid rate to facilitate inter and intra company communications but their network infrastructure is ill prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type datapower s xml acceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of xml that is required to support next generation enterprise applications said eugene kuznetsov cto and founder of datapower technology datapower gives companies the ability to use xml that s critical to web services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance a single datapower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of servers breaking the performance bottleneck associated with xml processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment in addition the datapower platform provides enhanced xml security protection against xml based denial of service attacks connection of e business protocols for incompatible xml data streams load balancing between back end servers and real time statistics reports in the post bubble economy technology investment decisions require laser focused scrutiny datapower s patent pending technology addresses a very real and growing pain point for enterprises said michael tyrrell of venrock associates by turbo charging their networks with datapower s unique xml aware networking technology companies will be free to adopt next generation web services without encountering performance and security pitfalls we looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly growing problems surrounding xml message processing performance and security said bill burnham of mobius venture capital datapower is on their third generation of technology their patent pending xml generation three xg technology was quite simply the single most compelling technology solution we have seen to date xml is not a nice to have it is a must have for enterprises serious about optimizing application efficiency since datapower has been developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of xml and web services said jeff fagnan of seed
