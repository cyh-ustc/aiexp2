 well for one it would free up the similar laptop i already got to just run amithlon or if that wasn t so fun bsd to run just openbsd this is a near term thing i could look forward to however an official laptop seems unexciting to me with only the items mentioned most important are the particulars distinguishing the listed spec from a dell preferably geforce go or newer pleasingly modern gpu the geforce go with mb video ram too little i have is not so much too slow as inefficient with factory settings it would actually crash from running too hot and too fast accelerating the ami and possibly openuae graphics is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments but an energy efficient gpu is a good sideeffect and portability read battery lifetime enabler great control over cpu state by use of internet keys wired to bios bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll wheel also hibernate that works please bootable to usb drives e g larger external ones in bios please p dells overheat they have a big heatsink and a little fan to pull air through it and if you don t elevate thelaptop off the desk or table or bed it s on the fan will stay on not good for mtbs mean time between service unless you ve got an angle on making money on service from amigans one excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs behind the amlcd thus using the backside of the display half as a radiator though it interferes with the case notion below yes aavid or such makes some as a standard part i prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative mass in elevating the laptop i e in the form of a catch handle and second logo device behind the laptop which generally provides stow and attachment for elevation legs move them out farther to get to the next higher ekevation until the sides of the laptop are met this also happens to provide a little protection for usb and cables that i tend to keep plugged in all the time a bit longer port life please a case color other than brown or black and preferably if the display module nre is entirely permissive the capability to run with the backlight off again to save battery power but also as a feature maybe you remember the ibooks modified in this manner the user has the privilege to pull out the backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe cf assembly with its backreflector and the whole warrantee this provides for excellent outdoor use often with the diffuser reinserted to keep depth of field distractions minimised what would i like a putty color any translucency in or over a rosewood colored in kde color browser i see chocolate firebrick and a couple of indian red that are great candidates base i would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight without closing the lid and to be able to fit an external light source such as a uv filtered solar collector and glare hood to feed into the backlight not only does this make an excellent color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably the logo should be a coloration of a minimal surface as the maa is trying to get me to renew with demos at http astronomy swin edu au pbourke geometry at first blush we ll see what comes out of the contest and maybe you ll like the mapping mathcad does of the logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the openness of amigaos ami and amiga community maa org has more references i m sure obviously elfin details e g the backlight inlet other details usb x preferred firewire would be needed if that s unavailable options like b or attabhable wifi hub for ethernet port should round out the offering an option for just released micron p with mobile power features could make more reviewers greenlight the series much better power consumption and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that compactflash smartmedia and mmc flash memory card interfaces would be very pleasant i ve mentioned booting to usb and booting from cf would be a pleasant extigency also to that end a backup solution with compression using usb storage or the multimode drive is always a nice bundle item that or a chance to back out a patch under os blue skies and clear water and fresh air waterproof to feet ethernet ports plus onboard wifi svelte line frontpanel lcd and bright red pager led builtin g cellphone functions choice of side and frontpanel trim ivory like stuff inscribed with m k memory map and various os structures or textured fur that says this is amiga speaking when stroked round decent keyboard as in toshiba or ibm laptops perhaps an ergonomic fingerworks com device they work as keyboard and mouse as the keyboard trackpad directional planar mics atop amlcd soundcard with multiple bit a d and noise reduction dsp that work in our second through fourth at least favorite os actual bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation fan location for real void comp the test in blade runner style cooling and extended bass active cooling and airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user seat and provide mineral water hypertransport ports
