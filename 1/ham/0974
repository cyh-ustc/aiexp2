 they are legally required to do that i got a similar check because an insurance company didn t pay a claim quickly enough it might have been although they spent lots more than to mail you the check the alternative seems to be to keep the money do you really want companies to have a financial incentive to over bill you just a bit so they could keep it for a company with millions of customers customer starts adding up from fork admin xent com mailto fork admin xent com on behalf of bitbitch magnesium net so i get a check from pac bell today sbc as they re called now turns out they went to the trouble of printing out signing sealing and stamping a check just to refund me for a whole they easily spent more than this just getting the materials together why the hell do companies bother to do this crap i mean isn t there a bottom line in terms of cost effectiveness i don t think i missed the but i sure as hell would have appreciated lower rates in lieu of being returned pennies i m truly stuck on this though i don t know whether to frame the check burn it or cash it in maybe i should find a way to return to sender so they have to spend more money on giving me my dues does even buy anything anymore funny bit of it is i couldn t even make a phone call these days boggled bb best regards bitbitch mailto bitbitch magnesium net
