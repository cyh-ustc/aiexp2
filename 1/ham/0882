 on mon at owen byrne wrote in my experience this is classic american behaviour and i don t think its on the increase outside of the us of a in my experience this protest behavior is really only an issue in ultra liberal coastal cities which is where i normally live it is part of the culture and that behavior is viewed as acceptable for comparison contrast this with the character of the arguably more serious protests against federal government abuse in the inter mountain west they have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptable protest practice those protests remain largely civil and polite if heated and aggressive and those involve a far greater percentage of the local population and unlike of the liberal coastal city protests i ve seen the people protesting in the inter mountain west are actually facing immediate dire consequences from the activities they are protesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that gets results some of their tactics such as the practice of many businesses and restaurants in northern nevada to not give service to anyone known to be in the employ of the blm and related agencies have been very effective at forcing dialog i don t recall anyone characterizing their protests as impolite rude or violent but then they have more to lose james rogers jamesr best com
