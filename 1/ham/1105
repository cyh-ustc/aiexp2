 on fri sep dale alspach wrote my experience has been that if the item is showing in xclipboard and is highlighted that is what is pasted using the mouse classic x copy and paste behavior is that you can only paste what is currently highlighted in fact it is the act of highlighting a selection that actually copies that selection into the buffer x has no copy command if you highlighted it you just copied it this does not seem to override what is in an application s own paste buffer as far as i can tell maple s cut and paste for example is isolated if ab application has a copy command that you can choose to use separately from the process of highlighting something that command is something the application authors wrote on their own and it it likely that an application that wrote an internal copy command would also have their own customized paste command to make sure the two work together whether the internal custom select and paste functions interoperate with the x server s global select and paste functions will vary from program to program because in each case you are relying on the program s authors efforts to blend separate systems jacob morzinski jmorzins mit edu exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
