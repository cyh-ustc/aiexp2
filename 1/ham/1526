 craig r hughes said seems like a good idea we might get one of two other issues raised tomorrow too once us people get back to work tomorrow and start downloading in earnest yep i reckon that s likely btw i m hearing reports about problems resolving spamassassin org anyone else noticing this if it s serious i ll see if i can get mark reynolds to add a ndary in the us to go with the primaries in oz looks like there may be a razor issue i think this is a razor bug glitch triggered when file permissions don t allow its own log system to work at least that s the report i heard on the razor list in the past theo does it work now that you dev null d the logfile version number says cvs tag tree as rel this time too i won t bother tagging with rel imo i don t think we should rely on the version control system inside our code so i ve just put a line in mail spamassassin pm instead i will of course tag with a release label though j
