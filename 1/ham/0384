 i finally let go of my irix magic desktop and window manager and evaluated several other window managers having lost my years of customization with my x and then x desktop at one point at uci i promised myself that i d never get attached to another wm i limped along in the default gnome desktop i had a few unsuccessful stabs at the solaris open view desktop but nothing really stuck because of this along with sgi s love of pre configured pre compiled freeware i never really made the jump from irix to linux either after installing the enlightenment wm i have to say i am really enlightened it s definitely a far cry from the no frills first look from previous versions it s only on version but it s a careful balance between simplicity performance fun features applications and ease of customization the number of themes they have on freshmeat is amazing after less than an hour or two of nesting i already have almost all my menus and controls setup just the way i want i definitely recommend this to any irix desktop holdouts it s a great way to refresh your machine sgi without having to bite the bullet and rebuild it as a linux machine greg http freeware sgi com http www enlightenment org http themes freshmeat net browse topic id http xent com mailman listinfo fork
