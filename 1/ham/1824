 tim one effect of getting rid of mincount is that it latches on more strongly to rare clues now and those can be unique to the corpus trained on e g one trained ham says gryndlplyx and a followup new ham quotes it this may be a systematic bias in the testing procedure in real life msgs come ordered in time say there s a thread that spans n messages on c l py in our testing setup we ll train on a random sampling throughout its whole lifetime and test likewise new ham in the middle of this thread gets benefit from that we trained on msgs that appeared both before and after it in real life it s quite plausible that the f p rate would rise without this effect in real life at any given time some number of ham threads will just be starting their lives and if they re at all unusual the trained data will know little to nothing about them
