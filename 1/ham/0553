 on am gary lawrence murphy wrote j if you want a region of the globe mapped out to a very j high resolution e g meter they can scan the area with j aircraft lidar and add it to the database thereby making that j region zoomable to the resolution of the database for that j area can you give us an example of an application where m resolution would be worth the considerable expense an example being able to model rf propagation in three dimensions for a metro area when deploying wireless networks by having every single tree and building detail and similar you can see even tiny dead spots due to physical blockage and signal attenuation overlay this with fiber map data for yourself and your competitors when you can glean such data which is also useful at this resolution and you have a very slick way of modeling existing network deployments in excruciating detail and optimizing further deployments to maximize coverage and bandwidth take that and tie it into a slick geo physically aware real time network monitoring and management system and you ve really got something for many applications though meter data is probably adequate james rogers jamesr best com
