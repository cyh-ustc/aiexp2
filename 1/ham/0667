 original message from luis villa they were the ruling class of a feudal farming society for quite some time i believe there were more than a few issues there certainly not everyone in tibet is as excited about the dalai lama as hollywood appears to be not that the chinese are much better rights wise but they ve actually built roads and such which led to the creation of merchant classes and the like that never existed under the tibetans and it s not going to exist under the tibetans because it ll be owned and operated by chinese nationals
