 tim i d prefer to strip html tags from everything but last time i tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora the full test results with and without html tag stripping is included in the what about html comment block but as the comment block also says xxx so if another way is found to slash the f n rate the decision here xxx not to strip html from html only msgs should be revisited and we ve since done several things that gave significant f n rate reductions i should test that again now i did so alas stripping html tags from all text still hurts the f n rate in my test data false positive percentages tied tied lost tied won tied tied lost tied won lost tied won tied tied tied tied tied tied tied won times tied times lost times total unique fp went from to false negative percentages lost tied lost won won lost lost tied lost lost won won lost lost lost lost won lost lost lost won times tied times lost times total unique fn went from to last time i tried this see tokenizer py comments the f n rate after stripping tags ranged from to with a median of about so we ve made tons of progress on the f n rate since then but the mere presence of html tags still remains a significant clue for c l py traffic so i m left with the same comment xxx so if another way is found to slash the f n rate the decision here xxx not to strip html from html only msgs should be revisited if we want to take the focus of this away from c l py traffic i can t say what effect html stripping would have i don t have suitable test data to measure that on
