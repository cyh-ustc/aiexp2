 i guess the first question here should be does anyone have some updates to the pgp code in exmh that i should know about my current problem is that if i get a pgp signed message i first get a button that reads check the signature with gnupg if i punch the button and i dont have the signature on my keyring then i get a message saying just that and the message can t check signature public key not found along with a button with the inscription query keyserver if i punch the button then exmh just hangs forever if instead of punching the button i go out to the keyserver myself and then try the message again everything works so it seems that it must be the code that goes out to the keyserver anyone else with this problem this is exmh v and tcl tk a reg clemens reg dwf com exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
