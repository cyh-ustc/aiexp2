 url http boingboing net date not supplied dan gillmor interviewed jack valenti last week in his column and did the impartial thing representing valenti s beliefs as fairly as possible this week dan takes valenti s arguments apart looking at what hollywood s agenda really entails so the movie and music companies are going back to congress for another helping they are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to restrict the capabilities of devices cripple pcs and other machines that communicate so they can t make copies the copyright holders don t explicitly allow amazingly the entertainment industry also wants permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used to violate copyrights here is what it all means to protect a business model and thwart even the possibility of infringement the cartel wants technology companies to ask permission before they can innovate the media giants want to keep information flow centralized to control the new medium as if it s nothing but a jazzed up television instead of accepting as they do today that a certain amount of penny ante infringement will occur and then going after the major league pirates they call every act of infringement and some things that aren t infringement at all an act of piracy or stealing saying it doesn t make it so link discuss http www siliconvalley com mld siliconvalley business columnists dan gillmor htm http www siliconvalley com mld siliconvalley htm http www quicktopic com boing h wduvxykf quj
