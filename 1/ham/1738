 on september tim peters said greg ward is currently capturing a stream coming into python org and i hope we can get a more modern and cleaner test set out of that not yet still working on the required config changes but i have a cunning plan but if that stream contains any private email it may not be ethically possible to make that available it will part of my cunning plan involves something like this if folder accepted ie not suspected junk mail if len recipients and recipients in guido python org barry python org folder personal if you and guido barry et al prefer i could change that last statement to folder none so the mail won t be saved at all i might also add a and sender doesn t look like bounce request admin clause to that if statement can you think of anyplace to get a large shareable ham sample apart from a public mailing list everyone s eager to share their spam but spam is so much alike in so many ways that s the easy half of the data collection problem i believe the spamassassin maintainers have a scheme whereby the corpus of non spam is distributed ie several people have bodies of non spam that they use for collectively evolving the sa score set if that sounds vague it matches my level of understanding greg greg ward http www gerg ca reality is for people who can t handle science fiction
