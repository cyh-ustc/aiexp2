 url http diveintomark org archives html history of the tilde date t so i was researching the history of the tilde because d told me that her company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any url with a tilde in it presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with remarkable accuracy a personal site and apparently her employer believes that reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time which to be honest is probably accurate given the nature of her work but never mind that i don t want to talk about corporate politics i want to talk about the tilde every command line loving geek will tell you that stands for home directory and cd will take you to your home directory cd username will take you to someone else s except on mac os x where it will take you to their public file sharing directory it is from this heritage that we can trace the present day practice of using tildes in urls to denote personal pages since one single system wide configuration allowed individual users to have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory or more commonly now that apache has taken over the world in their public html subdirectory except on mac os x where if you turn on web sharing and point your browser to http localhost username you re actually being served files from that user s sites directory within their home directory but i don t want to talk about mac os x i want to talk about the tilde as with so many other things i find that jukka korpela is the expert in this field jukka is no doubt a member of my karass a word which google old habits die hard feels is best explained by the personal site of eugene wallingford which like jukka s home page can not be referenced without a tilde in fact jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be used in urls a treatise which i feel obliged to point out contains a tilde in its url clearly the tilde is underappreciated digging further we find this post of jukka s from in which we learn that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all but rather an odd character called the overline presumably to balance out the underline if indeed those sorts of things require balance there is balance in the universe to be sure but i am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard no matter the tilde was the tilde so that spanish typing types could type the ntilde now referenced in html as the named entity ntilde but somewhere along the line it morphed into a general purpose character with all sorts of geeky uses digging even further it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for then an alternate for and its life as an overline replacement came even later jukka confirms this and adds a timeline for for for overline then june the watershed moment in an x committee meeting when it was proposed as exclusively a tilde in usa to appease share i can find no further reference as to what this acronym means or what this committee meeting was about the next reference isn t until when the tilde was officially added to iso and now down the rabbit hole we go scouring usenet which the kids of yesterday called deja news and kids today call google groups we find a reprint of a william safire yes that william safire article on language in which we learn that is officially pronounced squiggle this is confirmed by the jargon dictionary to this very day i m not sure this is useful but i just thought it was cool to see william safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various ascii characters as early as august tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem in july kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde in february an editor s note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that fidonet supported ascii characters space through tilde as early as january less used the tilde to denote lines past eof as early as july troff supported the tilde in november a mod sources post refers to bourne shell enhancements history tilde job control as early as january tilde was included on the dec keyboard and listed in the apl character set in april tilde was causing bugs in vi actually due to underlying bugs in csh in december is officially pronounced tilde prompting this typographical pun and that s the earliest reference i can find so where does that leave us unsatisfied no doubt there is history here but there are gaps what happened at that watershed meeting in how did the tilde rise to prominence in the s when did it become a synonym for home directory when did it migrate into the world of web servers to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web sites i don t know and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing my research a
