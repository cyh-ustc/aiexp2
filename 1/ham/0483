 jim whitehead wrote great this is half of what i d need to become spider man now all i need to figure out is how to do that spider web shooting thing heheheh so becomming a university professor was your second career choice seriously though or not as the case may be the amazing spiderman had many other abilities to help him out most notable perhaps was his spidey strength and spidey senses the strength to weight ratio of a spider is so high that spiderman is able to throw a bus several city blocks with little effort his endurance is similarly enhanced as well as for the spidey senses well they re really great but afaik not really well explained in the comic series spiders have multiple eyes ears noses and tongues which peter parker did not visibly have there have been a few attempts to explain his heightened reflexes from the biological to hidden methamphetamine use but none seem to do the spidey sense justice i seem to recall spiderman being able to detect the presence of well concealed weapons and even sense evil doers while they were in their street clothes perhaps the spidey senses are the result of some sort of quantum entanglement elias
