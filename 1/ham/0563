 on pm gary lawrence murphy wrote my car is only just over meters across and maybe meters long so that means roughly six pixels total surface area you might find a wheeler this way but how often do people misplace a wheeler such that it is that important to get old images of the terrain since they can t send up aircraft to update images in realtime every time how is this different from just releasing the map on dvds why wireless it seems that several people are missing the point that this is not an image database it is high resolution topological data rendered in three dimensions images are overlayed on the topological data to help people navigate familiar terrain visually in other words it is not intended as a wannabe spy satellite rather it is a very accurate three dimensional model of the earth s surface when a particular region in question is covered in a city the buildings in the city are mapped as though they are part of the earth s surface the part that makes the app killer is that you can map all sorts of data layers on top of their core topological data got it james rogers jamesr best com
