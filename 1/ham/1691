 huq bwerxvnrxx content type text plain charset us ascii content disposition inline gary funck in my experience there are spam messages that sneak past spam assassin that razor will pick up those are the ones that i m calling marginal basically i m hoping that the collective of razor users make a better judge of spam than any single program like sa can and therefore i can benefit from their judgement and get more extensive spam filtering i ve seen examples of this already where sa doesn t score the spam high enough to bounce it but razor does i think perhaps you missed the fact that sa scores are adjustable if you want sa to tag all messages listed in razor then you can put this in your spamassassin user prefs file score razor check the default score is and the default threshold needed is therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by sa then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above would be sufficient if you are already using sa then the above would be more efficient otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice once for sa and once again afterward if you really want to run razor individually then you should set the score razor check so that sa won t do it and avoid the double network hit however one of the benefits of using sa in combination with razor has been the history of false positive reports in the razor database the current score of is hefty but not enough by itself to tag as spam but for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold razor addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide of use as razor bob huq bwerxvnrxx content type application pgp signature content disposition inline begin pgp signature version gnupg v gnu linux id dbqe iv k prco e ulyrajoaaj cb lpbhphqa ijx l g lrivdwcfuzib kuak zsrwl ptb trequy xvm end pgp signature huq bwerxvnrxx this sf net email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven http thinkgeek com sf razor users mailing list razor users lists sourceforge net https lists sourceforge net lists listinfo razor users
