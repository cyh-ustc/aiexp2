 on sun sep reza b far ebuilt wrote c and c forces the developer to solve problems such as memory management over and over again imho java is superior because the problem of programming in the future is not about s and s making the compiler faster or making your code take less memory it s about design patterns architecture high level stuff considering of the fake job posting i see are for embedded systems or device drivers c still rules the world java is not just a programming language it s also a platform there is nothing like the standard api s in java in c and c everyone defines their own api s people end up solving the same problems ten different ways the problem is the problem you re trying to solve is never the same java will soon suffer api rot alot of poeple are already complaining about it it s just new c was clean in the beginning too api rot is purely a function of age if you have a program of any type of high complexity written in c you can t possibly think that you could port it to different platforms within the same magnitude of cost as java i do this all the time it s alot easier then you think if the original programmer had a clue at all java does remove the clue requirement tho just adds a huge testing requirement qa guys aren t as cheap makes no sense for a scientific or a business project to depend on a person java imho reduces the dependence of these entities on the individual developer as it is much easier to reverse engineer java as it is to reverse engineer c large applications no it s not but you can hire teams of javites for cheap at your local high school java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming and it s working adam l duncan beberg http www mithral com beberg beberg mithral com
