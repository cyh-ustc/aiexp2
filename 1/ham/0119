 i need to setup a vpn between a few sites from what i ve read the the choices come down on the linux side to ipsec using freeswan or cipe it seems that freeswan is better being an implementation of ipsec which is a standard however cipe does the job as well for linux clients and is somewhat simpler to setup the problem is that it s not a pure linux situation a couple of the sites run os x i m pretty sure that i ll be able to find an implementation of ipsec for os x but i think cipe is linux only so the question is for those of you have have implemented both is there a significant difference in setup time and hassle between cipe and freeswan if cipe is going to be much easier than dealing with freeswan and whatever on the os x sites then i ll simply get a linux box for each of the remote sites with the low price of hardware it doesn t take much more complexity in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic niall irish linux users group ilug linux ie http www linux ie mailman listinfo ilug for un subscription information list maintainer listmaster linux ie
