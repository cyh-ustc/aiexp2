 misc rants about finding jobs java vs c what makes a good programmer etc okay hmm i thought twice about this but what the hey jobs are hard to come by there s a company hiring in mountain view looking for a few good hackers no java no gui not even c just c and linux and networking and good old stuff like that they just raised a wad of money and they re looking for a few really good programmers says the cto i know him very smart guy drives too fast though for what that s worth joe bob says check it out i d be happy to pass on your resume or you can send it straight to them probably won t matter if i pass it on since i don t know you guys anyway http www netli com sherry original message from joseph s barrera iii mailto joe barrera org sent tuesday august am to adam l beberg cc fork example com subject re java is for kiddies adam l beberg wrote forwarding me stuff from a list is hardly handing me a job i was talking about the open reqs at kana the company i work for oh but programming in java is beneath you nope just lacking years and years of it for some silly reason people always want things to be reliable fast and cross platform so all my employers have forced me to code in c c is more reliable than java as for cross platform c exists on more platforms but a java program is much easier to move from one platform to another so i m not sure what you mean i m not trying to fight a language war but i m puzzled by the depth of your anti java hatred i know lots of high school kiddies with plenty of java tho not having to teach people about pointers or optimization or anything shaves years off the coder boot time i ll send them your way when they graduate pointers so a language has to have pointers to be real and references don t count i gather what s so great about pointers why do you miss them if your doing embedded stuff fine yes you need the performance and control over memory that c provides probably but if your implementing tier n of a tier n system and pounding against a database then java is often a very reasonable choice especially if you want that system to run without leaking memory optimization who says you can t optimize java i can and have and there are good tools that allow you to do it i use optimizeit but usually i find myself optimizing reducing database accesses instead i sped one part of the system up by a factor of ten by grouping more operations into fewer transactions but this is beside the point if you have decent c experience and have poked around in java you should be able to convince most employers that you can be trusted writing java that s what i did i mean i joined kana from microsoft and i didn t exactly write a lot of java code at microsoft i m not displeased you re trying to help just frustrated that employers can demand such rediculous combinations of skills with insane years of experience i don t think i ve ever interviewed at a place where i actually met all the prerequisites do you just give up when you don t interview tommorow with kodak doing i have no idea what as the recruiter isnt even sure but cross your fingers it wont require years of java and years of windows ia s device driver experience both common requirements i wish you best of luck and i apologies for being a bitch but god damn you piss me off sometimes my son occasionally displays your can t do attitude and i do my damnest to get him to reverse course joe
