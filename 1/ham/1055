 things first the switch parser changed in a subtle way with byte code compilation was added and it is slightly more strict in its parsing than the original parser you can only have a comment where tcl would expect to find a command switch has a pattern body strucutre so if you goof and put a comment where it is trying to find a pattern both of you will be confused with the results the subtlty arises with extra whitespace and newlines i can t give you the exact case but i know exmh had one example that stopped parsing correctly and was arguably wrong before nd i ve managed to remain fairly ignoranat of the pgp support in exmh so you ll have to dig in yourself or see if someone else on exmh users or exmh workers is having similar problems reg clemens said if you haven t already you should enable the debug log under hacking support preferences and look for clues there reg clemens said hi on sun sep mdt reg clemens wrote in messages with gnupg signatures but punching the line always gives signature made thu aug mdt using dsa key i d bdd f a can t check signature public key not found so something else is missing yes the public key of the signature you want to check are you really sure that you have the public key of the message s signature if not try downloading it or try to check a signature fro m which you know you have the public key ah sorry for not making that clearer but no previously v of gnupg there would be a slight pause at this poin t whi le it went out to get the public key from a keyserver now whether i have the key or not i get the failure message its as if it cant find gpg to execute it but i fixed that path so th ere must be something else that i am missing reg clemens reg dwf com exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users brent welch software architect panasas inc pioneering the world s most scalable and agile storage network www panasas com welch panasas com partial solution and this may be related to using tcl tk b as i had a similar problem about a month ago elsewhere in exmh which you found but first i really feel like something has changed out from under me with my making no changes to exmh namely when i first got gpg up and working for reading signatures all i did was touch the check signature button and it went out and queried the keyserver for me now im getting a separate box after the failure to find the public key on my keyring asking me of i want to query keyserver i know that i never had to touch a query keyserver button in the past but there it is now and i havent touched exmh spooky i have been working back and forth between gpg and but its not clear how that could be the problem as im now getting the query message when running either ok enough about my confusion the current problem seems to be a comment in a switch statement at line in pgpwww tcl tcl b doesnt like it and i get your popup box remove it and no popupbox but exmh hangs sigh so not a complete solution but at least a start thanks for the interest reg clemens reg dwf com brent welch software architect panasas inc pioneering the world s most scalable and agile storage network www panasas com welch panasas com exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
