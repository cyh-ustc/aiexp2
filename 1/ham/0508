 ouch hooooo cheers rah begin forwarded text status ro date thu sep from same guy subject re electric car an edsel to r a hettinga bob this guy s an idiot i design loads for systems with the kv capacitors one of those has of such capacitors and stores only megajoules which means kilojoules each they weigh kg you need high energy per unit mass and the capacitive system i picked maximizes that it is precisely the system that maxwell is touting for electrical braking and power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles you also need voltage you can use in a dc motor which is why though the actual capacitors in the system are charged to volts the system has them arranged in series to boost the voltage ignore him he s a waste of my time from r a hettinga subject re electric car an edsel date wed sep to some people begin forwarded text status ro date wed sep pdt from adam l beberg to r a hettinga cc subject re electric car an edsel on wed sep r a hettinga wrote maxwell www maxwell com makes and sells high energy density capacitors called ultracapacitors they deliver them in an air cooled voltage regulated module that will charge to v and hold kilojoules roughly the energy in teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut and weighs kilograms if that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic energy there s enough to get the capacitor module up to about mph in a vacuum since the energy you can pack into a capacitor is something like c v you want to design your system with the lowest voltage possible to fully exploit that v so yea a v system will only be useful for accelerating insects not cars that must be why kv is standard not the joke of putting into goggle to find that model was not missed btw most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors as very few real world applications run for less then seconds like the car we were talking about originally even seconds is pushing the capactior is the wrong choice limits thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one it s got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady discharge curve but it should be safe to say that most people want the indy version not the mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice for those you dont want a battery or a capacitor you want to take advantage of whole atoms not just electrons then you can suck off the electrons you need with a fuel cell however you will use both capacitors for the braking accel and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design adam l duncan beberg http www mithral com beberg beberg mithral com end forwarded text r a hettinga the internet bearer underwriting corporation farquhar street boston ma usa however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity predicting the end of the world has not been found agreeable to experience edward gibbon decline and fall of the roman empire end of original message end forwarded text r a hettinga the internet bearer underwriting corporation farquhar street boston ma usa however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity predicting the end of the world has not been found agreeable to experience edward gibbon decline and fall of the roman empire
