 of course they had to do this after we purcahsed these all on vhs and yes it is now run by the great evil empire known as disney but we got the new school house rocks dvd anyway and man is it an amazing item first off my year old has been singing them since she was second off these are much easier to rip to divx and mp third new songs remastered originals and other dvd goodies its a dvd set so its well worth the we paid for it even if you dont have kids run do not walk to pick this one up man i would sure love to have a nix rocks for the kids
