 robin lynn frank writes i may be dense but why would anyone want to utilize habeus to me it looks like a potential backdoor to anyone s defenses against spam if i were a spammer i d simply set up a server send out my spam with the habeus headers and continue till i was reasonably certain i d been reported then i d simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different ip as long as no one can establish my connection to the web sites my spam is directing people to i m home free here is the bug i opened http www hughes family org bugzilla show bug cgi id rbls have the same problem but there is no negative rbl header rule with a score that can be forged so the problem is unique to habeas since i can set up spamassassin to i don t lose any email what do i gain by making it easier for spam to get through my primary issue is the magnitude of the negative score and that it was not determined empirically i am also concerned that it was added after the rules freeze that such a major change was not discussed in advance etc there s also no evidence that the rule will actually reduce fps people who are smart enough to use the rule are probably capable of writing email that doesn t look like spam i m not counting spam mailing lists which you need to be exempted from spam filtering dan this sf net email is sponsored by jabber the world s fastest growing real time communications platform don t just im build it in http www jabber com osdn xim spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk lists sourceforge net https lists sourceforge net lists listinfo spamassassin talk
