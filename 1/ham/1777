 tim my tests train on about msgs and a binary pickle of the database is approaching million bytes that shrinks to under million bytes though if i delete all the wordinfo records with spamprob exactly equal to unknown spamprob such records aren t needed when scoring an unknown word gets a made up probability of unknown spamprob such records are only needed for training i ve noted before that a scoring only database can be leaner in part the bloat is due to character gram ing part due to that the database is brand new so has never been cleaned via clearjunk and part due to plain evil gremlins
