 on mon at matthias saou wrote eek maybe it s just me but i don t think that s a good idea outputting a message in post and providing a readme of some kind would be better as well as perhaps adding a note in description why eek if no dev dvd exists it ll create it if dev dvd exists it won t touch it i assume that you won t ghost or remove these and the modules conf change on uninstall though so people who are installing this rpm and are unfortunate enough to have a dvd drive or just an ordinary cd non dvd drive that doesn t support dma will be left with a system without a working cd drive even after removing the rpm and without ever knowing what struck them you can t remove the dma setting from modules conf either unless you re sure that ogle added it there and nothing else needs it the dev stuff isn t that dangerous but the modules conf change can be that s why eek if someone installs ogle a dvd player i m assuming the hardware is recent enough for software playback and that the drive is a dvd rom all of them support dma but since that change requires a reboot or a manual change i m still hesitating to integrate it a worthy goal my goal is to allow users to install a dvd player through synaptic and play dvds in no time outputting a message in the post section of a package is always a bad idea putting the tip in the description sounds good though how about splitting the creation of the symlinks and modules conf modifications into a separate rpm ille skytt ville skytta at iki fi rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
