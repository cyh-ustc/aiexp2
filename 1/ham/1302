 i use a mostly red hat system but prefer to configure and build my kernel by hand i d like to humbly offer a tweak to alsa driver spec that helps it build cleanly under such circumstances i recognize that freshrpms net packages are designed with standard red hat in mind including a standard kernel rpm however i hope that matthias will consider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation the diff is attached below the first part of the diff contains a conditional that checks to see if the expected rpm is installed if it is karch is set as before and a new krpm flag is set to if the expected rpm is not installed then karch is instead set using uname p while krpm is left undefined the second part of the diff is simpler we only require that kernel source be installed if the kernel itself came from an rpm if the kernel was hand built the presumably the user knows enough to have retained the sources in the expected place again i realize that i m operating off warrantee by not using a red hat kernel rpm matthias if you think this tweak is reasonable and not too ugly i d love to see you pick it up if not well at least this message will sit in the archives and may help other folks in the future rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
