 http www cnn com world americas peru mother reut index html lima peru reuters lina medina s parents thought their year old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in peru s andes could find no cure her father carried her to hospital just over a month later she gave birth to a boy aged years seven months and days old when her child was born by caesarean section in may medina made medical history and is still the youngest known mother in the world at the time peru s government promised aid that never materialized six decades on medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor crime ridden district of the peruvian capital known as little chicago now she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past gerardo the son she delivered while still a child herself died in at the age of but a new book written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case has drawn fresh attention to medina s story and raised the prospect that the peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance the government condemned them to live in poverty in any other country they would be the objects of special care jose sandoval author of mother aged told reuters we still have time to repair the damage done to her that s my fundamental objective he added totally willing to help sandoval has raised medina s case with the office of first lady eliane karp and has asked the government to grant her a life pension something officials say is possible we re totally willing to help her said spokeswoman marta castaneda but suni ramos of the social action department of karp s office said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning such as kitchen and other household equipment it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed it is currently trying to contact medina and her family medina s husband raul jurado told reuters his wife remained skeptical she got no help in that i know about he said she thinks governments never deliver maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true jurado said his wife whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists had turned down reuters request for an interview medical rarity no one has ever established who was the father of medina s child or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped one of nine children born to country folk in ticrapo an andean village at an altitude of feet meters in peru s poorest province medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history sandoval said he said she had her first period at became pregnant aged years and eight months and that when doctors performed the caesarean to deliver her baby they found she already had fully mature sexual organs her swelling stomach worried her parents they thought it was a tumor he said but shamans ruled out village superstitions including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town pisco there came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest he was later released for lack of evidence and doctors police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case sandoval who based his book on media and other published information and some interviews with relatives as medina herself declined to comment said news of the child mother to be drew instant offers of aid including one worth from a u s businessman which was turned down more offers followed after medina was transferred to a lima hospital where her fully developed pound kg baby was born on may mother s day one offer was worth a week plus expenses for medina and her baby to be exhibited at the world s fair in new york another from a u s business that the family accepted in early june was for the pair to travel to the united states for scientists to study the case the offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort but within days the state trumped all previous offers decreeing that medina and her baby were in moral danger and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them but sandoval said it abandoned the case after six months it did absolutely nothing for them happy ending though physically mature medina who sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms still behaved like a child preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby who was fed by a wet nurse medina stayed in hospital for months finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a supreme court ruling allowing her to live with them again after taunting from schoolmates gerardo who was named after one of the doctors who attended medina and became their mentor discovered when he was that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother he died in from a disease that attacks the body s bone marrow but sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young medina married and in had a second son years after her first her second child now lives in mexico she appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject we just want to get on with our lives that s it said jurado adding he thought absolutely nothing of the fact his wife was the world s youngest mother he said the couple s main concern now if the government s offer of aid was genuine was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to medina and which the then government expropriated more than two decades ago that house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site he said its value was more or less and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own they live now in a modest house accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves paradise if the government really wants to help they should give us the value of our property he said as for sandoval he said he was optimistic that medina s story which he has studied since his student days would turn out well i believe there will be a happy ending he said as a result of the war corporations have now been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the republic is
