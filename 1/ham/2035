 url http www mozillazine org weblogs hyatt date not supplied bug has to do with enabling different toolbar modes it s a pretty basic browser feature that has been missing from navigator for years even simplified browsers like chimera have this feature neil did some excellent work in and his code finally landed it naturally spiked startup time and window time slightly and so it ended up being backed out because of mozilla s no tolerance policy for regressions while this line in the sand policy is in many ways a good one i feel like it misses the point there is a natural tendency when designing applications to add features in every new version of the software only rarely do you see features removed with each passing version you get more and more bloated relying on faster machines and more memory to save the day who cares if the user interface is now full of menu items you still support every last feature since version so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied you can really only cram so many features into a product before its size requirements and performance requirements have to change this is an obvious rule it s like you start with an empty elevator that says capacity people the elevator stops at the first floor version and a bunch of people features get on continuing on its journey the elevator stops at the second floor and still more people get on the elevator is now full and it continues to the third floor version unfortunately the elevator is full but there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on some of them squeeze in anyway past the fat person from the first floor the mozilla sidebar feature who is taking up enough space for people everyone wishes he d get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor but he doesn t someone the mozilla wallet feature from the second floor cuts one on the way to the third floor so he s useless and everyone wishes he d get off too he doesn t though nobody does people keep piling in at floor after floor until eventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies we need to forcibly eject people from the elevator remove the features that nobody wants and replace them with the features that matter cull out the features that didn t work in mozilla and make sure they aren t there in mozilla make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want some of the more obscure features and that have powerhouse machines can go download them on their own only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat will we finally produce an awesome mozilla browser
