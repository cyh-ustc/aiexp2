 i have a couple of small issues and i m not sure if their exmh issues or my setup issues first when i try and run exmh with wish from tk it seems to take forever to start but with wish from tk a it starts in a snap using the latest cvs when i open exmh and the folder i m in has unseen messages and i hit next exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages rather than to the first unseen in the current folder finally when i reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to the next unseen exmh always goes back to inbox which has no unseen messages rather than the next folder with unseen messages when i goto next from inbox it does go where i would think it should go just wanted to let you know what i m seeing and find out if i m expecting some different than i should be thanks for all the effort jim exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
