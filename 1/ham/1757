 ns neil schemenauer writes ns writing an imap server is a non trivial task that s what i ve been told by everyone i ve talked to who s actually tried to write one ns alternatively perhaps there could be a separate protocol and ns client that could be used to review additions to the training ns set each day a few random spam and ham messages could be ns grabbed as candidates someone would periodically startup the ns client review the candidates reclassify or remove any ns messages they don t like and add them to the training set i think people will be much more motivated to report spam than ham i like the general approach that copies of random messages will be sequestered for some period of time before they re assumed to be ham matched with a simple spam reporting scheme this could keep the training up to date with little effort i ve sketched out an approach a listserver like mailman could do along these lines and if i get some free time i ll hack something together i like the idea of a pop proxy which is classifying messages as they re pulled from the server the easiest way for such a beast to be notified of spam might be to simply save the spam in a special folder or file that the pop proxy would periodically consult barry
