 original message from the parties are screaming and shouting over political figures because they cannot be heard to those figures in any other way the right to speak is not the same as the right to be heard by the audience of the speakers choice disruptive protests might be a means to create awareness but that s a pretty lame way to do it if it truly is the only way then i m all for it but disruption for the sake of showing how committed the protesters are is pretty weak
