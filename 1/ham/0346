 once upon a time brian wrote ok it s now time to work out the pgp securing of apt repository traffic i ve never gotten anything but sitename whatever will not be authenticated until running redhat when i get something about having no key for various files i don t think gpg signing my repositories will help anything as it will just ensure that my passphrase was typed to confirm the md signatures of all pgklists and srclists basically you ll then just be sure that it s me who generated the files and this will of course prevent automating the process of updating the apt repository when red hat updates show up in red hat linux though the warnings about no key appear until you import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm for example rpm import usr share doc apt cnc rpm gpg key this will import my key which is used to sign all freshrpms net packages hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install only packages who verify against an imported gpg key this for me would be the optimal way to ensure integrity with the way things curently work matthias clean custom red hat linux rpm packages http freshrpms net red hat linux release valhalla running linux kernel acpi load rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
