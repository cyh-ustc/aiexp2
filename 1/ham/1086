 gotta wonder what the gpg config stuff in exmh exmh defaults looks like also gotta wonder what the message headers in the offending message are saying to nmh exmh my set up works perfectly that is i get a pop up window to enter my passphrase into and when i type it correctly the message display changes from a prompt to click to decrypt to the message content ttfn on september at brent welch wrote hmm i m cc ing the exmh workers list because i really don t know much about the various pgp interfaces i think there has been some talk about issues with the latest version of gpg hacksaw said version linux habitrail home fools errant com smp smp thu sep edt i unknown tk tcl it s not clear to me this is a bug with exmh per se but it s something that manifests through exmh so i figured asking you might help me track it down when i receive a gpg encrypted message and it asks me for a passphrase it first tries to ask me via the tty under which exmh is running it tells me my passphrase is incorrect every time at which point exmh offers me the line in the message about decrypting i click the line and it offers me the dialog box and tells me the passphrase is correct and shows me the decrypted message any ideas on that honour necessity http www hacksaw org http www privatecircus com kb fvd exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
