 guys the habeas infringers list hil exists explicitly to deal with spammers while we re getting judgments against them and especially in other countries where those judgments are harder to get please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers yes some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes and isps have won some theft of service suits but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles so i can t understand how daniel can assert that you can t track spammers down when it s never really been tried we can subpoena the records of the business they spammed on behalf of we can subpoena the records of the isp that provided them service and of the credit card they used for the whack a mole accounts we can use private investigators yes these people are often lowlifes chickenboners but they re not secret agents they re just trying to make a buck and habeas whole business is about finding them and putting them out of business habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers that use our warrant mark in a way that no one ever has had before given that our whole business plan relies on habeas becoming synonymous with not spam i can t understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be unsuccessful plan for that failure and in so doing remove the potential of success which is anti spam filters like sa acting on the habeas warrant mark daniel it s easy enough for you to change the habeas scores yourself on your installation if habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to non spammers and to place all violators on the hil then i have no doubt that justin and craig will quickly remove us from the next release but you re trying to kill habeas before it has a chance to show any promise at the end of the day spamassassin is like the club in that it encourages thieves spammers to just go after the next car those without sa rather than yours habeas can play the role of lojack the transmitter in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don t steal any more cars but only if we re given a chance to succeed dan dan kohn original message from daniel quinlan mailto quinlan pathname com sent wednesday august to matthew cline cc spamassassin talk example sourceforge net subject re satalk o t habeus why matthew cline writes there must be some way of tracking a spammer down since they are planning on making money from the spam what a court would consider evidence of being the spammer is another question haha just a few notes it will be difficult to find prosecute and win money from someone in various non friendly countries where spam originates china is a good example even if they do officially respect copyright law law suits take time between now and conclusion of the first court case we could have years of spam in our mail boxes contact information can change phone numbers po boxes stolen cell phones temporary email addresses etc spammers do not always remember to include contact information i don t understand it either but nobody said they were bright also some spam is non commercial or sent by a third party for example pump and dump stock scams so contact information is not strictly required for the spammer to get their way dan this sf net email is sponsored by jabber the world s fastest growing real time communications platform don t just im build it in http www jabber com osdn xim spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk lists sourceforge net https lists sourceforge net lists listinfo spamassassin talk this sf net email is sponsored by jabber the world s fastest growing real time communications platform don t just im build it in http www jabber com osdn xim spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk lists sourceforge net https lists sourceforge net lists listinfo spamassassin talk
