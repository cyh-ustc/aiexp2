 remove jeremy alum mit edu tim yuck it got two s from embedding your email address at the tim bottom here which suggests that tagging email addresses in to cc headers should be handled differently than in message bodies i don t know whether it suggests that but they would be tagged differently in to cc if i were tagging them at all right now if i were tagging to addresses for example the tokens would look like to email addr mit instead of email addr mit as they appear when an email like thingie is found in the body whether email addresses should be stuck in as one blob or split up as they are now is something i haven t tested
