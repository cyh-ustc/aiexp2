 i am trying to manage the email for a domain which i have hosted with hosting and am trying to get the whole email send and receive thing working nice and easily at the moment i have configured fetchmail to poll the different pop mailboxes and deliver the mail accordingly although it appears that i have to have only one unix user being able to receive from each pop mailbox this could be a limitation of the fetchmailconf programme i m not sure but it would be much handier if i could just tell it to collect all of the mail from the different mailboxes and then deliver it locally according to the to header instead of the pop mailbox it came from the other issue i am having is sending outgoing mail i have been trying to use sendmail but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior and when the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if i have checked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes and i don t know how to set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail do any of the outgoing mailer programs exim or postfix or whatever have a nice configuration interface or do they all have nice friendly configuration files like sendmail any suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated there are only three or four email addresses in my domain and setting it up for scheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me fine thanks david david hamilton senior technical consultant hp ireland irish linux users group ilug linux ie http www linux ie mailman listinfo ilug for un subscription information list maintainer listmaster linux ie
