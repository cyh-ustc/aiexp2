 thanks for this information i gave alsa a try couldn t figure out how to enable digital out although i m sure if i put enough time into it could have gotten it working also when playing mp s in analog mode every time i switched between mp s there was a bit of static noticed a new distribution geared towards audio applications agnula http www agnula org uses alsa as well seems though the latest open source emu k drivers sblive work fair enough anyone else experience these problems with alsa are there alot of people on this list using alsa regards lance on sat at angles puglisi wrote fyi this is how i make my alsa rpms some people on the null list did not realize it was pretty easy btw i do this lot since i ve upgraded from rh to limbo to limbo to null all in a week probably forward original mail from angles puglisi date pm subject re when are we going to get from angles puglisi to limbo list example com subject re when are we going to get date aug ok i do this every time i update a kernel the st time i added alsa i tried a non root rpom build but the dev things were not made other than that i bet you could do non root the following can be scripted easily get a alsa drivers b alas lib and c alsa utils tarballs if upgrading the kernel then you probably have them from your last install unpack them somewhere for each of them go to the top directory of the unpacked tarball and do configure then look in i m going by memory topdir utils you should see a spec file there do this for the tarballs and you get spec files put the source tarballs in sources and the spec files in specs go in order from a b then c doing rpmbuild ba specs alsa x spec rpm uvh rpms i alsa x rpm do that in order for the spec files and you have just installed the alsa drivers on your system the st time you do this you need to put the correct stuff in your modules conf file may take some research then you get the alsa driver and oss compat capabilities or you can choose not to use the oos compat stuff script making the spec then building and upgrading as above and you have no sweat alsa note the null rpmbuild did take some tweaking it does a check for files in the buildroot that you don t specify in your files section in this case there is an extra file going by memory include sys asound h add a line at the end on the install section of the spec file to delete that file and you are good to go gordon messmer yinyang eburg com wrote on fri at matthias saou wrote probably when red hat linux gets a kernel until then a few places provide good quality alsa packages but indeed you still have to patch and recompile your kernel not so alsa is build able independently of the kernel maybe some day i ll try alsa never done it yet and that day you can expect all needed packages to appear on freshrpms net i d be interested in working with you on that if you want those packages limbo list mailing list limbo list redhat com that s angle as in geometry linux one stanza tip lost sub extracting lines x to y in a text file lost use sed syntax sed n x yp textout fil rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
