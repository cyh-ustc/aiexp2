 date wed aug from chris garrigues message id the background color in this window is the same as the background color in the ftoc that s what i d like to vary particularly as the ftoc background isn t constant messages in the unseen sequence have a different background than others in the ftoc that s fine but in the sequences window it isn t needed unseen already has a different foreground there no problem with that it doesn t need a different background as well i ll play about a bit with this and with making it vertical instead of horizontal and see what turns up the only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined in app defaults color or exmh exmh defaults color ok i ve been thinking about how to dynamically generate highlighting for other sequences but haven t got that figured out yet in this case highlighting wasn t what i was most concerned about a method to get messages in out of sequences comes first how it displays is a secondary consideration but as a suggestion have an all unknown sequence highlight any message in a sequence which has no defined highlighting where defined includes defined to not be treated specially gets highlighted the same way maybe something as boring as a dark brown text colour almost indistinguishable from the normal black any chance of making the current message a little brighter background i don t see any reason why not experiment and let me know what works for you done some of that first the most significant change came from changing relief from raised to sunken i don t know why but it just looks better for me anyway but even with that cur and unseen are still just a bit too similar i ended up using sequence cur background palegoldenrod relief sunken borderwidth the unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours i was using had spaces in their names palegoldenrod translates as eee aa which is probably safer for generic use kre exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
