 i think i ve worked on sa enough to understand that i can localize a score i m just not comfortable with using spamassassin as a vehicle for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base this is exactly what i think spamassassin has always been conservative about adding unproven rbls and such and this should be the same i think it would make more sense to start habeas with a less aggressive score one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyone s inbox and after we ve seen evidence that the system works then we can increase the magnitude of the score i say start it with a zero score and put it in cvs rules under test like any other unproven rule then score it based on actual results not promises my corpus does not yet contain a single non spam or spam message with a habeas mark based on that it doesn t impress me and it wouldn t impress the ga either rules with exactly the same statistics are being dropped from sa right now and i don t see why this should be any different michael moncur mgm at starlingtech com http www starlingtech com furious activity is no substitute for understanding h h williams this sf net email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven http thinkgeek com sf spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk lists sourceforge net https lists sourceforge net lists listinfo spamassassin talk
