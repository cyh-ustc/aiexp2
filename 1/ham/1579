 jm jmason org justin mason writes date in past spam phrase spam phrase spam phrase spam phrase spam phrase i was thinking of just removing those particular rules but keeping the other entries in the range since they re proving too noisy to be effective but i d be willing to keep those ones in all the same what do you think matt craig thoughts i think i could handle commenting out the lowest spam phrase xx yy scores if the ga could handle this sort of thing so they d automatically be zeroed i d feel better since the ranges could change next time the phrase list is regenerated or the algorithm tweaked i think we need to understand why date in past is so low before we remove it the two rules on either side perform quite well and here are the rules that seem like they should be better or should be recoverable from missing gappy text invalid msgid mime null block subj missing well i don t like subj missing i reckon there s a world of mails from cron jobs e g which hit it okay drop subj missing but yes the others for sure should be recoverable and i m sure there s more probably a few those seemed like the best prospects to me btw do you agree with the proposed methodology ie remove the rules and bugzilla each one i only want a bugzilla ticket for each one if people are okay with quick wontfix closes on the ones deemed unworthy of recovery if you could put the stats for each rule in the ticket somehow should be automatable with email at the very least it would help dan
