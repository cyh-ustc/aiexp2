 dave long wrote the united states is the only country in the world to tax its citizens on a worldwide basis i am told this is also true at least for australia i suppose i shouldn t rely upon editorial fact checking if they manage to emulate the process that occurred in northern ireland then maybe in years or so they ll be yelling at each other across the floor of some legislative assembly instead label me an optimist since let s you and him fight worked so remarkably poorly in ireland there must ve been plenty of places it worked well for the british to have tried it again in israel what were they dave i m not sure what you mean by let s you and him fight but it is important to remember that england was in control of ireland for years and that it was only thanks to the distraction of ww i that the south managed to gain its independence if you mean splitting countries upon arbitrary lines and assigning different groups to opposite sides of the line it also seems to have not worked in india pakistan i suppose canada which is supposed to be a loose confederation of founding nations french and english can be cited as a success the jury is still out but so far only a few brief rebellions and referendums and such still together after years owen
