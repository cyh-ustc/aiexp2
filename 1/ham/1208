 date sun sep from brent welch message id i would encourage folks to play with those lines of code in text selection and report what works well for them we may come up with lines that work for everyone or perhaps introduce yet another setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models of course that s an admission of policy failure but i m willing to do that i actually think you re looking in the wrong place i at least have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted or selected that stuff for me if perhaps not users of some gnome variant which appraently has been fixed anyway all seems to work just fine the problem is that a button click clears the selection primary where it shouldn t the previous selection should only be cleared when there s something else to replace it even if the highlighting of what is selected is removed try this in any other ramdom application from xterm to netscape and see how it works there normally is no mouse based way to actually clear the primary selection that is set it to be a null string then because of the if i get asked for the selection value i will find something behaviour if you click intending to set the insert point the way most other gui s operate and then paste because the primary is clear but exmh still owns the selection because nothing else has taken it it does and finds some other ramdom stuff from either the clipboard or cut buffer which tends to be something that was deleted back in the ancient past and pastes that that behaviour to me anyway is the real issue once that gets fixed we can switch back to operating the normal select stuff click at new insert point paste mode of operation that almost everyone expects to work whether the select stuff is somewhere in one of the exmh windows or elsewhere kre ps this message is from my experience as a exmh user only i ve never really understood enough about x and selections to go gazing at that part of the code and see how it all really operates exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
