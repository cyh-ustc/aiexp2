 software vendors have been trying since forever to prevent software piracy remember when you had to enter a specific word from a specific page of the software manual which was printed on dark maroon paper so that it could not be photocopied didn t work propritery encoding of dvd s didn t work software that required the use of a registration key didn t work windows xp was shipped with this supposedly revolutionary method for stopping piracy and what happened how long was it before the code was cracked how many keygens are there for windows xp is someone running a pirated version of xp really going to use windows update to installed a service pack which breaks their os just because m didn t include the change in their readme fat chance my problem is not the same as ms s one i don t have to deal with millions of identical copy of the same cd with propably millions of working keys each download can be unique with a small preparation delay the key generator is a problem only if multiple keys are usable if the end users are teenagers you ll face a huge wall when asking to be of the time online but if we think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients personnal information the end user will be willing to take every possible steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly i agree with all of you that mass production cds will not be safe from piracy in a near futur that can be seen as a collateral of mass market penetration btw thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight i m playing with gdb s dissassembler now but i don t think it s what a typical cracker would use any hints on unix cracking tools thanks yannick gingras coder for obb onside brainsick bract http openbeatbox org
