 lol they re not doomed at all thousands of men wear cb s to work every day along with other chastity devices they are not just decorations you will not get a woody or have an orgasm until your keyholder allows you to anyhow i know better than to have this type of conversation with a nilla but these men wear these happily and consensually there is little power struggle in the lifestyles of the people who use these there is power exchange instead lots of variations on the definition but this one s from gloria brame s site power exchange the consensual transfer of power by the submissive to the dominant the exchange takes place when the returned energy from the dominant empowers the submissive anyhow there are tons of informative sites out there for anyone who cares to read them but i assure you the chastity device business is doing very well and it is illegal to force someone to wear one it s not coercion it is creative sensuality cindy on thu sep eirikur hallgrimsson wrote on wednesday september pm cdale wrote someone needs to tell the mayor about this http www cb com chastity technologies were doomed from the start and i ll add chemical ones to the trash heap yeah cindy these are decorative toys for the subculture but generally someone is attempting to preserve a relationship with this nonsense when quite plainly the the relationship is in a state where preserving it is of little value hardware is of no real use save for playing the power struggle game i don t want to see the future of this invisible fence for your mate must wear location transponders and endocrine monitors more movies like minority report it seems so automatic for people to reach for coercive solutions so surprizing given the low absolute effectiveness of coercion in the absense of overwhelming force advantage eirikur i don t take no stocks in mathematics anyway huckleberry finn
