 guido there seem to be two drivers for the classifier now neale pickett s hammie py and the original gbayes py according to the readme txt gbayes py hasn t been kept up to date it seemed that way to me when i ripped the classifier out of it i don t think anyone has touched it after is there anything in there that isn t covered by hammie py someone else will have to answer that i don t use gbayes or hammie at least not yet about the only useful feature of gbayes py that hammie py doesn t yet copy is u which calculates spamness for an entire mailbox this feature can easily be copied into hammie py that s been done now right gbayes py also has a large collection of tokenizers but timtoken py rules so i m not sure how interesting that is now those tokenizers are truly trivial to rewrite from scratch if they re interesting the tiny spam ham collections in gbayes are also worthless now the self test feature didn t do anything except print its results tester py since became doctest ed and verifies that some basic machinery actually delivers what it s supposed to deliver therefore i propose to nuke gbayes py after adding a u feature here anyone against
