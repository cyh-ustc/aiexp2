 exmh p content type text plain charset us ascii from scott lipcon date mon sep chris i m home now and this copy of exmh is pretty bad i m running from cvs on sunday night the only change since then was the one you made this morning for bulletproofing in mhreadseqs i run exmh and i can visably see it count up the number of unseen messages as it looks through the folders i have about unseen messages in maybe or folders it takes a few seconds for all of the folders in the fcache to turn blue this is true it s now looking at more than just unseen so it takes a little while in the background to build the sequences window there is probably some tuning possible in this area in inbox i have unread messages they aren t blue they are white background with a normal colored font i changed the default display of unseen messages from a foreground of blue to a background of white to make it possible to see what other sequences unseen messages may be in i did ask brent before i did it if you like the old behavior the old lines are still in app defaults color but commented out if i click on a message i get the following traceback invalid command name mh markseen while executing mh markseen exmh folder msgid procedure hook msgshow update unseen line invoked from within cmd mhprofile path exmh folder msgid mimehdr procedure msgshow line invoked from within msgshow msgid procedure msgchange line invoked from within msgchange show invoked from within time list msgchange msgid show procedure msg change line invoked from within msg change msgnum show procedure msg pick line invoked from within msg pick lineno show procedure ftocrangeend line invoked from within ftocrangeend lindex split ftoc t index current command bound to event this is because of your hook msgshow update unseen which is calling a function which no longer exists i suspect you need seq del exmh folder unseen msgid now instead of mh markseen exmh folder msgid it appears that the message does get marked as seen though as it loses the white background and nmh reports the same if i click the flist button it zero s the unseen count and then there is again a visible delay as it counts up all the unseen messages maybe seconds i really think my installation is ok now but if this behavior is just really strange i ll blow everything away and reinstall i m happy to spend some time helping to track this down i don t really need exmh i m comfortable enough using nmh scott exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers chris garrigues http www deepeddy com cwg vircio http www vircio com congress suite austin tx world war iii the wrong doers vs the evil doers exmh p content type application pgp signature begin pgp signature version gnupg v gnu linux comment exmh version id dbqe j opk b h r iuiraqayaj t yu ti tfv ps do dixdacfyxbp v bkp o yrqjd mqmxewcm yk end pgp signature exmh p exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
