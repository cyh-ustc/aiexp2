 this is not an exmh problem but an interaction between sendmail solaris and mh your sysadmin is wrong it is the responsibility of the receiving mail server to escape lines beginning with from if they choose to turn on that facility it is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the stupid design of the unix mail spool and sun s even more stupid decision to rely on content length instead of dealing with this problem since mh is unaware of content length rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the spool i had this same problem there are several ways to fix it get your mail administrator to add the e flag to your sendmail this means you will never see a line beginning with from any such line will look like from there is a patch to mh to make it respect content length when i was having this problem porting this patch to nmh was low on the priority list then nmh development stalled for a long time i doubt it has been done but you can check with the nmh list at nmh workers mhost com to find out for sure you can learn to use procmail invoking rcvstore directly instead of letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool this avoids the whole issue rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time and everything works jim mcmaster mailto mcmasjc tatanka stortek com in message jason rennie said when i receive a message that has a line starting with from it s broken into two messages i get my mail from var spool mail the program that incorporates mail thinks that the from line starts a new message my sysadmins have told me that the sending mail client is supposed to escape lines begining with from exmh doesn t do this should it it appears that my mh is mh does nmh fix this jason d m rennie mit ai lab jrennie ai mit edu http www ai mit edu jrennie exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
