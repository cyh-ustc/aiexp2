 reply to the mail from ben mord bmord icon nicholson com hi hello this concept could also be applied to the application servers and even the database server partitions except for those partitions which contain the table data files of course although the data might just be the information that needs protecting does anyone do this already or is this a new concept i ve seen this implemented for a shell server although they chose to have their root on a cd wr in a cd r drive which meant that even when compromised it was only possible to examine other users data afair emember they just swapped cd s when a root exploit was found thanks for any opinions np blaze your trail redhat i am become shiva destroyer of worlds
