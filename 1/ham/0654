 s stephen d williams writes s a which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its s past certainly not christianity islam etc rastafari that is if you concede that of the two founding branches only the one founded by the nyabingi were legit and the others were thinly veneered anti colonial hooligans there is also vietnamese buddhism unless you count setting fire to oneself as a foul action s c many splinter christianity religions have clean hands but s they also aren t found in the wild you d have to explain found in the wild for example i know of no violence perpetrated by the south pacific cargo cults outside of a pretty darn mean game of cricket s d the northern ireland protestant vs catholic feud recently s more or less concluded is not completely unlike this kind of s friction generated by splitting society too much along s religious lines one post article pointed out that the problem s basically stemmed from the vertical integration of areas along s religious lines all the way to schools government political s party etc of course both cases have a heritage of british s conquest but who doesn t when we launched the native net in one of the first things we noticed on networking aboriginal groups around the world is that the british army with the us army as a proxy by extension were the common thread where neither was present physically or through influence there tended to be less violence the issue in ireland is complex but rest assured that religious aspects are only a co incidence of the invader colonials being predominantly members of the royal headed anglicans and the aboriginal population being predominantly members of the pope headed catholics the conflict itself has nothing to do with ideology or practice since the anglican church is a near identical clone of catholicism now i bet that s going to attract some healthy debate s most protestants are unionists who want the s province to remain part of britain mebst mebst it s the other way around most unionists are protestants it s their unionism that is the source of the conflict not their sacriments s police records and historians agree that the most lethal s group by far was the ira fighting on the catholic side with a s goal of a united ireland and which side of the colonial fence do you suppose the police and historians sit if the russians had invaded the usa as feared in episodes such as the bay of pigs would the americans have organized to become a lethal force or would they have just said oh well there goes that democracy and settle in under communist rule just wondering the us is trying to avoid making war on the muslim religion it is interesting to me that the canadian media is trying to paint chretien as some sort of buffoon for saying that rd world poverty was a major contributor to if they d watch his now infamous interview they d see that it s still us against hooligans but his point is that the hooligans would not be able to find friendly states so easily if those states were not so bled dry by the west the same is true of street gangs when people are disenfranchised it s easier to offer them the triad as a new family you get cellphones cars a dry place to live triad biker gangs mafia the ira al queda we ve been fighting the war on terrorism for as long as there s been commerce so you d think we d realize that escalation of violence is not a solution gary lawrence murphy garym teledyn com teledynamics communications blog http www auracom com teledyn biz http teledyn com computers are useless they can only give you answers picasso
