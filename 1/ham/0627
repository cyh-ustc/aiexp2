 minutes ii bush interview cbs no president since abraham lincoln has seen such horrific loss of life in a war on american soil no president since james madison nearly years ago has seen the nation s capital city successfully attacked but one year ago president george w bush was thrown into the first great crisis of the st century this is the president s story of september th and the week america went to war minutes ii spent two hours with mr bush one on air force one and another in the oval office last week even after a year the president is still moved sometimes to the point of tears when he remembers sept i knew the farther we get away from sept the more likely it is for some around the world to forget the mission but not me mr bush says during the air force one interview not me i made the pledge to myself and to people that i m not going to forget what happened on sept so long as i m president we will pursue the killers and bring them to justice we owe that to those who have lost their lives the memories come back sharp and clear on air force one where pelley joined the president for a recent trip across country minutes ii wanted to talk to him there because that is where he spent the first hours after the attack not since lyndon johnson was sworn in on air force one has the airplane been so central to america in a crisis for president bush sept started with the usual routine before dawn the president was on his four mile run it was just before a m and at the same moment another man was on the move mohammad atta two hours later as mr bush drove to an elementary school hijackers on four planes were murdering the flight crews and turning the airliners east as the motorcade neared the school at a m jet engines echoed in manhattan atta plunged the jumbo jet into world trade center tower one i thought it was an accident says mr bush i thought it was a pilot error i thought that some foolish soul had gotten lost and and made a terrible mistake mr bush was told about the first plane just before sitting down with a class of second graders he was watching a reading drill when just after nine united flight exploded into the second tower there was the sudden realization that what had seemed like a terrible mistake was a coordinated attack back in the florida classroom press secretary ari fleischer got the news on his pager the president s chief of staff andy card stepped in a second plane hit the second tower america is under attack card told the president when he said those words what did he see in the president s face i saw him coming to recognition of what i had said card recalls i think he understood that he was going to have to take command as commander in chief not just as president what was going through bush s mind when he heard the news we re at war and somebody has dared attack us and we re going to do something about it mr bush recalls i realized i was in a unique setting to receive a message that somebody attacked us and i was looking at these little children and all of the sudden we were at war i can remember noticing the press pool and the press corps beginning to get the calls and seeing the look on their face and it became evident that we were you know that the world had changed mr bush walked into a classroom set up with a secure phone he called the vice president pulling the phone cord tight as he spun to see the attack on tv then he grabbed a legal pad and quickly wrote his first words to the nation ladies and gentlemen this is a difficult moment for america he said in the speech today we ve had a national tragedy it was a m as he spoke mr bush didn t know that two more hijacked jets were streaking toward washington vice pesident dick cheney was in his office at the white house when a secret service agent ran in he said to me sir we have to leave immediately and grabbed put a hand on my belt another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the door of my office cheney recalls i m not sure how they do it but they sort of levitate you down the hallway you move very fast there wasn t a lot of time for chitchat you know with the vice president says secret service director brian stafford who was in his command center ordering the round up of top officials and the first family he felt that he had only minutes to work with we knew there were unidentified planes tracking in our direction he says cheney was rushed deep under the white house into a bunker called the presidential emergency operations center it was built for war and this was it on her way down national security advisor condoleezza rice called mr bush it was brief because i was being pushed to get off the phone and get out of the west wing says rice they were hurrying me off the phone with the president and i just said he said i m coming back and we said mr president that may not be wise i remember stopping briefly to call my family my aunt and uncle in alabama and say i m fine you have to tell everybody that i m fine but then settling into trying to deal with the enormity of that moment and in the first few hours i think the thing that was on everybody s mind was how many more planes are coming the capitol was evacuated and for the first time ever the secret service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of succession agents swept up the officials who stood to become president if the others were killed they wanted to move vice president cheney fearing he was in danger even in the bunker but cheney says when he heard the other officials were safe he decided to stay at the white house no matter what it s important to emphasize it s not personal you don t think of it in personal terms you ve got a professional job to do says cheney cheney was joined by transportation secretary norm mineta who remembers hearing the faa counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the capital says mineta someone came in and said mr vice president there s a plane miles out then he came in and said its now miles out we don t know where it is exactly but it s coming in low and fast it was american flight at a m it exploded into the pentagon the first successful attack on washington since the war of as the pentagon burned mr bush s limousine sped toward air force one in florida at that moment united flight the last hijacked plane was taking dead aim at washington at the white house the staff was in the west wing cafeteria watching on tv press secretary jennifer millerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate i no sooner walked outside when someone from the secret service yelled women drop your heels and run drop your heels and run and suddenly the gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and the whole white house just flooded out she recalls in florida as mr bush boarded air force one he was overheard telling a secret service agent be sure to get the first lady and my daughters protected at a m air force one thundered down the runway blasting smoke and dust in a full hrust take off communications director dan bartlett was on board it was like a rocket he remembers for a good ten minutes the plane was going almost straight up at the same moment minutes after it was hit world trade center tower two began to falter then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche of steel concrete and human lives someone said to me look at that i remember that look at that and i looked up and i saw and i just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and the horror of that moment recalls rice of the tv newscast she also felt something in her gut that we ve lost a lot of americans and that eventually we would get these people i felt the anger of course i felt the anger down in the bunker cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked planes there were officials feared there could be as many as as the planes track toward washington a discussion begins about whether to shoot them down i discussed it with the president cheney recalls are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these airliners that have been hijacked he said yes it was my advice it was his decision says cheney that s a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot down your own civilian aircraft says bush but it was an easy decision to make given the given the fact that we had learned that a commercial aircraft was being used as a weapon i say easy decision it was i didn t hesitate let me put it that way i knew what had to be done the passengers on united flight also knew what had to be done they fought for control and sacrificed themselves in a pennsylvania meadow the flight was minutes from washington clearly the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of government as they could the pentagon perhaps the capitol perhaps the white house these people saved us not only physically but they saved us psychologically and symbolically in a very important way too says rice meanwhile tower one was weakening it had stood for an hour and minutes at a m it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of its twin the image that went round the world reached the first lady in a secure location somewhere in washington i was horrified she says i thought dear god protect as many citizens as you can it was a nightmare by a m america s largest city was devastated its military headquarters were burning air force one turned west along the gulf coast i can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the consequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining moment in the history of the united states says president bush i didn t need any legal briefs i didn t need any consultations i knew we were at war mr bush says the first hours were frustrating he watched the horrifying pictures but the tv signal was breaking up his calls to cheney were cutting out mr bush says he pounded his desk shouting this is inexcusable get me the vice president i was trying to clear the fog of war and there is a fog of war says the president information was just flying from all directions chief of staff card brought in the reports there was word camp david had been hit a jet was thought to be targeting mr bush s ranch i remember hearing that the state department might have been hit or that the white house had a fire in it so we were hearing lots of different information says card they also feared that air force one itself was a target cheney told the president there was a credible threat against the plane using the code name for air force one mr bush told an aide angel is next the threat was passed to presidential pilot colonel mark tillman it was serious before that but now it is no longer is it a time to get the president home tillman says we actually have to consider everything we say everything we do could be intercepted and we have to make sure that no one knows what our position is tillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while secret service agents double checked the identity of everyone on board the crew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan then came a warning from air traffic control a suspect airliner was dead ahead coming out of sarasota there was one call that said there was an airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with tillman remembers tillman took evasive action pulling his plane high above normal traffic they were on course for washington but by now no one thought that was a good idea except the president i wanted to come back to washington but the circumstances were such that it was just impossible for the secret service or the national security team to clear the way for air force one to come back says bush so air force one set course for an underground command center in nebraska back in washington the president s closest advisor karen hughes heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to mr bush and the military operator came back to me and in a voice that to me sounded very shaken said ma am i m sorry we can t reach air force one hughes recalls hughes was out of the white house during the attacks when she came back it was a place she didn t recognize there were either military or maybe secret service dressed all in black holding machine guns as as we drove up and i never expected to see something like that in in our nation s capital says hughes when she walked into the white house no one was inside i knew it was a day that you didn t want to surprise anybody and so i yelled hello and two again kind of swat team members came running running through the the hall with again guns drawn and then took me to to the location where i met the vice president on air force one col tillman had a problem he needed to hide the most visible plane in the world a longer than the white house itself he didn t want to use his radio because the hijackers could be listening to air traffic control so he called air traffic control on the telephone we actually didn t tell them our destination or what directions we were heading says tillman we we basically just talked to em and said ok fine we have no clearance at this time we are just going to fly across the united states controllers passed air force one from one sector to another warning each other to keep the route secret ok where s he going one tower radioed to another just watch him a second tower responded don t question him where s he s going just work him and watch him there s no flight plan in and we re not going to put anything in ok sir air force one ordered a fighter escort and air traffic control radioed back air force one got two f s at about your o clock position the staff and the president and us were filed out along the outside hallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows says bartlett and the president gives them a signal of salute and the pilot kind of tips his wing and fades off and backs into formation the men in the f s were shane brotherton and randy roberts from the texas air national guard their mission was so secret their commander wouldn t tell them where they were going he just said you ll know when you see it and that was my first clue i didn t have any idea what we were going up until that point says brotherton he knew when he saw it we we were trying to keep an mile bubble bubble around air force one and we d investigate anything that was within miles says roberts bush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this aircraft or for his own safety i looked out the airplane and saw two f s on each wing it was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to get us we now know that the threat to air force one was part of the fog of war a false alarm but it had a powerful effect at the time some wondered with the president out of sight was he still running the government he hadn t appeared after the attack on washington mr bush was clearly worried about it at one point he was overheard saying the american people want to know where their dang president is the staff considered an address to the nation by phone but instead mr bush ordered air force one to land somewhere within minutes so he could appear on tv at a m they landed at barksdale air force base in louisiana the resolve of our great nation is being tested but make no mistake we will show the world that we will pass this test god bless bush said to the nation from barksdale at barksdale the secret service believed the situation in washington was still unsafe so the plane continued on to nebraska to the command center where mr bush would be secure and have all the communications gear he needed to run the government aboard air force one mr bush had a job for press secretary fleischer the president asked me to make sure that i took down everything that was said i think he wanted to make certain that a record existed says fleischer fleischer s notes capture mr bush s language plain and unguarded to the vice president he said we re at war dick we re going to find out who did this and kick their ass another time mr bush said we re not going to have any slap on the wrist crap this time the president adds i can remember telling the secretary of defense i said we re going to find out who did this and then mr secretary you and dick myers who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs are going to go get them by p m air force one touched down at offutt air force base in nebraska mr bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that gave no hint of what they would find below at the bottom of the stairs was the u s strategic command underground command center it was built to transmit a president s order to go to nuclear war but when mr bush walked in the battle staff was watching the skies over the united states many airplanes had still not landed after a short briefing mr bush and card were taken to a teleconference center which connected them to the white house the pentagon the fbi and the cia mr bush had a question for his cia director george tenent according to rice bush asked tenent who had done this rice recalls that tenent answered sir i believe its al qaeda we re doing the assessment but it looks like it feels like it smells like al qaeda the evidence would build fbi director robert mueller says that an essential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed a flight attendant on american flight amy sweeney had the presence of mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the seat numbers of the hijackers that was the first piece of hard evidence we could then go to the manifest find out who was sitting in those seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those individuals as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and going through a process of elimination says mueller in nebraska the white house staff was preparing for an address to the nation from the air force bunker but by then the president had had enough he decided to come back at one point he said he didn t want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him out of washington fleischer says that verbatim on board he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world i had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged one was that you re guilty if you harbor a terrorist because i knew these terrorists like al qaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people the other thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition of countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists as air force one sped east the last casualty of the attack on america collapsed one of the nation s worst days wore into evening at the world trade center were killed at the pentagon and in pennsylvania altogether there were dead anybody who would attack america the way they did anybody who would take innocent life the way they did anybody who s so devious is evil bush said recently mr bush would soon see that evil face to face after arriving in washington he boarded his helicopter and flew past the pentagon on the way to the white house was there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a white house to return to i don t remember thinking about whether or not the white house would have been obliterated he recalls i think i might have thought they took their best shot and now it was time for us to take our best shot mr bush arrived back at the white house nine hours after the attacks his next step was an address to the nation karen hughes and her staff were already working on the speech he decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was reassurance remembers hughes we had to show resolve we had to reassure people we had to let them know that we would be ok just off the oval office mr bush added the words that would become known as the bush doctrine no distinction between terrorists and those who harbor them the staff wanted to add a declaration of war but mr bush didn t think the american people wanted to hear it that night and he was emphatic about that he prepared to say it from the same desk where franklin roosevelt first heard the news of pearl harbor now bush was commander in chief eighty million americans were watching today our fellow citizens our way of life our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts he said from the oval office that night the oval office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in american history since the civil war before he walked to the white house residence for the night mr bush dictated these words for the white house daily log the pearl harbor of the st century took place today we think it s osama bin laden cbs when sept dawned president bush was demanding a war plan no one in the white house or the pentagon could be sure of what the president would do in office for just eight months he d never been tested as commander in chief i never asked them what they thought president bush said of the pentagon brass because i didn t really because i knew what i was gonna do i knew exactly what had to be done scott and that was to set a strategy to seek justice find out who did it hunt them down and bring them to justice in the cabinet room the president made clear what was next the deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against our country were more than acts of terror they were acts of war he said to the war cabinet al qaeda was no surprise national security advisor condoleezza rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to strike bin laden s organization well before sept the president said you know i m tired of swatting at flies i need a strategy to eliminate these guys rice recalls in one of the worst intelligence failures ever the cia and fbi didn t pick up clues that an attack in the united states was imminent without a sense of urgency the white house strategy the president had asked for came too late chief of staff andrew card recalls that the plan mr bush had asked for was literally headed to the president s desk i think on the eleventh tenth or eleventh of september on sept the war cabinet was debating the full range of options who to hit and how to hit them there were some at the pentagon who worried in the early hours that mr bush would order up an immediate cruise missile strike of the kind that had not deterred bin laden in the past well there s a lot of nervous nellies at the pentagon anyway mr bush tells pelley a lot of people like to chatter you know more than they should but no i appreciate that very much secretary of defense donald rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what we called boots on the ground that if you re gonna go to war then you ve gotta go to war with all your assets the president says he wanted to fight and win a guerilla war with conventional means it was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by cia director george tenent tenent wanted to combine american technology and intelligence with the brute force of afghan fighters hostile to the taliban government secretary of state colin powell noting that the cia had already developed a long relationship with the afghan resistance called it an unconventional solution to an unconventional problem as i like to describe it to my friends powell says we had on the ground a fourth world army riding horses and living in tents with some cia and special forces with them and we had a first world air force the best in the world how do you connect it all the president gave them hours to figure it out meanwhile mr bush went to the battlefield himself just the day before he had called the pentagon the mightiest building in the world now one fifth of it was in ruins the wreckage of american flight was being examined by navy investigators and before mr bush left he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering the remains of the first casualties of war on his watch the next day sept there was another warning of attack that the public never heard about threats had been were coming in constantly but this one sounded credible a large truck bomb headed to the white house the secret service wanted the president back in the bunker he wasn t real receptive to that to that recommendation remembers brian stafford director of the secret service and he ordered a hamburger and said he was going to stay in the white house that evening and that s what he did the next day would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the president on friday sept mr bush started the day with a cabinet meeting but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause he sat down slightly overcome for a moment but he recaptured it says powell who remembers being worried that the president might have trouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service later that morning and i just scribbled a little note to him powell recalls and i said mr president i ve learned over the years when you are going to give a very emotional speech watch out for certain words that will cause you to start to tear up he looked at me and he smiled and then at the next break in the conversation he said the secretary of state told me not to break down at the memorial service and that broke the tension and everybody started laughing and i felt embarrassed first lady laura bush was involved in planning the memorial service and she says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting i wanted the psalms and everything to be read to be comforting because i think we were a country that needed everyone of us needed comforting it also stirred the mourners resolve as rice remember as we stood to sing the battle hymn of the republic she says you could feel the entire congregation and i could certainly feel myself stiffen the kind of spine and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve we all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had been lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what had happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually going to be safe from this kind of attack ever again next came a visit to ground zero the president was not prepared for what he encountered there you couldn t brief me you couldn t brief anybody on ground zero until you saw it mr bush says it was like it was ghostly like you re having a bad dream and you re walking through the dream the president found the scene very powerful particularly when the men and women at ground zero began to chant usa usa there was a lot of bloodlust the president recalls people were you know pointing their big old hands at me saying don t you ever forget this mr president don t let us down the scene was very powerful very powerful when mr bush tried to speak the crowd kept shouting we can t hear you the president responded i can hear you i can hear you the rest of the world hears you and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon mr bush had been in new york just a few weeks before he d posed with the firemen who always stood by whenever the president s helicopter landed there now five of the men who stood with the president in the picture were dead lost at ground zero when the president arrived sept manhattan was papered with the faces of the lost families unable to believe that so many had vanished in an instant held onto the hope that their loved ones were just missing it was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother at a meeting the public never saw the president spoke with several hundred of these families in a convention hall people said to me he ll come out don t worry mr president we ll see him soon i know my loved one he will he ll find a place to survive underneath the rubble and we ll get him out i on the other hand had been briefed about the realities and my job was to hug and cry but i remember the whole time thinking this is incredibly sad because the loved ones won t come out one little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his firefighter uniform and as he signed it mr bush remembers he told the boy your daddy won t believe that i was here so you show him that autograph it was an effort to provide a little hope the president recalls i still get emotional thinking about it because we re dealing with people who loved their dads or loved their mom or loved their wives who loved their husbands it was a tough time you know it was a tough time for all of us because we were a very emotional and i was emotional at times i felt i felt the same now as i did then which is sad and i still feel sad for those who grieve for their families but through my tears i see opportunity the president was supposed to be with the families for about minutes he stayed for two and a half hours it was there he met arlene howard the body of her son george was among the first to be found at ground zero i called the police department howard remembers and they said he hadn t called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and i said no i don t need to call back if he hadn t called in i knew where he was george howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in when the world trade center was bombed he had been off duty that day and he was off duty on sept but couldn t stay away the police department gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president he the president he leaned over to talk to me howard recalls and he extends his sympathy to me and that s when i asked him i d like to present george s shield to him in honor of all the men and women who were killed over there by the end of that day mr bush flew to camp david visibly drained he was physically exhausted he was mentally exhausted he was emotionally exhausted he was spiritually exhausted recalls card the next day saturday sept mr bush met members of his war cabinet at the presidential retreat for a last decisive meeting my message is for everybody who wears the uniform get ready the united states will do what it takes mr bush told them as powell remembers it he was encouraging us to think boldly he was listening to all ideas he was not constrained to any one idea he wanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other president bush was pleased with the progress that had been made on the other hand he says i wanted to clarify plans and i went around the room and i asked everybody what they thought ought to happen when he left that meeting on saturday night he still had not told the cabinet what he was planning i wanted to just think it through mr bush remembers any time you commit troops to harm s way a president must make sure that he fully understands all the consequences and ramifications and i wanted to just spend some time on it alone and did what were his reservations mr bush says could we win i didn t want to be putting our troops in there unless i was certain we could win and i was certain we could win nine days after the attacks on america before a joint session of congress the president committed the nation to the war on terror each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it happened mr bush told the congress and the nation we ll remember the moment the news came where we were and what we were doing some will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever and i will carry this it is the police shield of a man named george howard who died at the world trade center trying to save others it was given to me by his mom arlene as a proud memorial to her son it is my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end a year has passed since then but the president says his job is still to remind americans of what happened and of the war that is still being waged a war he reminds himself of every day in the oval office literally keeping score one terrorist at a time in his desk the president says i have a classified document that might have some pictures on there just to keep reminding me about who s out there where they might be and as the terrorists are captures or killed i might make a little check there yeah mr bush admits but there is no check by the name that must be on the top of that list osama bin laden cbs a lot has happened in the year since sept one year ago the president was new on the job with little experience in foreign policy he had wanted to pull the military back from foreign entanglements now on his orders u s forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did not expect in a world completely changed in the oval office last week cbs news correspondent scott pelley asked the president about iraq about whether americans are safe at home and about osama bin laden scott pelley you must be frustrated maybe angry after a year we still don t have osama bin laden president bush how do you know that i don t know whether osama bin laden is dead or alive i don t know that he s not leading a lot of parades and he s not nearly the hero that a lot of people thought he was this is much bigger than one person anyway this is we re slowly but surely dismantling and disrupting the al qaeda network that that hates america and we will stay on task until we complete the task i always knew this was a different kind of war scott see in the old days you measure the size and the strength of the enemy by counting his tanks or his airplanes and his ships this is an international manhunt we re after these people one at the time they re killers period pelley but have you won the war before you find osama bin laden dead or alive mr bush if he were dead there s somebody else to replace him and we would find that person but slowly but surely we will dismantle the al qaeda network and those who sponsor them and those who harbor them and at the same time hopefully lay the seeds for the conditions necessary so that people don t feel like they ve got to conduct terror to achieve objectives pelley do you look back on the afghan campaign with any doubts certainly we ve overthrown the taliban government certainly al qaeda has been scattered but some of the taliban leaders appear to have gotten away and there have been many civilian casualties as well mr bush uh huh well you know i am sad that civilians lost their life but i understand war we did everything we can to everything we could to protect people when civilians did die it was because of a mistake certainly not because of intention we liberated a country for which i m extremely proud no i don t second guess things it s things never go perfect in a time of war pelley are you committed to ending the rule of saddam hussein mr bush i m committed to regime change pelley there are those who have been vocal in their advice against war in iraq some of our allies in the gulf war saudi arabia turkey for example even your father s former national security advisor mr scowcroft has written about it in the paper what is it in your estimation that they don t understand about the iraq question that you do appreciate mr bush the policy of the government is regime change scott hasn t changed i get all kinds of advice i m listening to the advice i appreciate the consultations and we ll consult with a lot of people but our policy hasn t changed pelley on air force one you described the terrorists as evil mr bush yeah pelley i don t think anyone would disagree with that but at the same time many in the arab world are angry at the united states for political reasons because of our policy in israel or our troops in the oil region of the middle east is there any change in foreign policy that you re considering that might reduce arab anger against the united states mr bush hmm well i m working for peace in the middle east i m the first president that ever went to the united nations and publicly declared the need to have a palestinian state living side by side with israel in peace i ve made it clear that in order for there to be peace the palestinians have gotta to get some leadership that renounces terror and believes in peaces and quits using the palestinian people as pawns i ve also made it clear to the other arab nations in the region that they ve got responsibilities if you want peace they gotta work toward it we re more than willing to work for it but they have to work for it as well but all this business isn t going to happen as long as a few are willing to blow up the hopes of many so we all gotta work to fight off terror pelley arafat has to go mr bush either he s he s been a complete failure as far as i am concerned utter disappointment pelley there has been some concern over the year about civil liberties mr bush yeah pelley in fact an appeals court recently was harsh about your administration s decision to close certain deportation hearings they said quote a government operating in secrecy stands in opposition to the constitution where do you draw the line sir mr bush i draw the line at the constitution we will protect america but we will do so on within the guidelines of the constitution confines of the constitution spirit of the constitution pelley is there anything that the justice department has brought to you as an idea that you ve thought no that s too far i don t wanna go mr bush nah not that that i remember and i am pleased with the justice department i think that attorney general s doing a fine job by the way and to the extent that our courts are willing to make sure that they review decisions we make i think that s fine i mean that s good it s healthy it s part of america pelley franklin roosevelt said that america should stand in defense of four freedoms freedom of speech freedom of religion freedom from want and freedom from fear do we have that today mr president freedom from fear mr bush i think more than we did in retrospect the fact that we are on alert the fact that we understand the new circumstances makes us more free from fear than on that fateful day of september the th we ve got more work to do pelley and americans should not live their lives in fear mr bush i don t think so no i think americans oughta know their government s doing everything possible to help and obviously if we get information that relates directly a particular attack we ll deal with it and if we get noise that deals with a general attack we ll alert people there are a lot of good folks working hard to disrupt and deny and run down leads and the american people need to go about their lives it seems like they are
