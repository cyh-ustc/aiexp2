 danq i think it would make more sense to start habeas with a less danq aggressive score one which will not give spammers a quick path danq into everyone s inbox and after we ve seen evidence that the danq system works then we can increase the magnitude of the score better yet let the ga figure out the correct score that will obviously take awhile since you ll have to acquire enough messages with it but it should give you a good idea if the presence of habeus headers are good spam indicators or not if they are my guess is that habeus will probably not succeed taking things further off topic does habeus charge a license fee to organizations who want to use their copyrighted material or is their sole revenue stream to come from legal judgements on the one hand if they charge license fees i d worry that when times got tough they d be somewhat less critical of organizations we d call spammers today in order to generate license fees if not i d worry the pendulum would swing the other way and they d go after legitimate businesses in an attempt to generate more revenues from judgements and or out of court settlements either way it seems like they have an interesting tightrope to walk skip montanaro skip pobox com consulting http manatee mojam com skip resume html this sf net email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven http thinkgeek com sf spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk lists sourceforge net https lists sourceforge net lists listinfo spamassassin talk
