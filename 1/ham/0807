 anyone who doesn t appreciate both pluck and luck is only looking at part of the equation america has in fact moved hard toward meritocracy but and this is a huge one you don t necessarily find it on the forbes list there is an element of luck even if only being in the right place at the right time to go that high beyond the forbes list there are many ways in which almost pure luck is involved in significant wealth being a super model for example though i think most people would be surprised by a lot of super models cindy crawford was valedictorian of her high school most people of course aren t in those stratified realms it is the rest of us who tend to sort there is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of merit in the first place rawls claims merit doesn t exist sowell seems to agree at least in part but i m sure sowell would also state that the benefits of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous and if merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring iq purity of heart or the ability to satisfy customers functionally most people seem to equate merit with iq though they say it would be better if it were purity of heart yet the type of merit that lands you on the forbes list or even just being a garden variety millionaire next door is more likely to be the serving customers definition differences due to merit when they are perceived as such generate far more animosity than differences due to luck luck can be forgiven superior performance often not original message from fork admin xent com mailto fork admin xent com on behalf of geege schuman sent

horseshit happy or otherwise however i resent being lumped in a zero sum zealot category for suggesting nothing more than that rich and successful at face value is apropos of nothing and i am beginning to understand that people who immediately and so fiercely object to my ad hominem re cheney align themselves weird sylogisms like if rich then deservedly or if rich then smarter given that i am also beginning to understand why some people need to be rich wrt to meritocracies all hail meritocracies wrt harvard over of graduates were cum laude interesting curve those eager to be measured

seem to have ivy league educations or are ivy league dropouts suggesting to me that they weren t exactly poor to start with actually if i remember correctly from discussion of the list s composition in forbes about five or six years ago the best way to get on the forbes is to have no college at all can you say bootstraps boys and girls i knew you could given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school like say mine is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a government run high school you ll probably get more of those on the forbes as well as time goes on if we ever get around to having a good old fashioned government collapsing transfer payment depression an economic version of this summer s government forest conflagration caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clear cutting enough forests did out west this summer that should motivate more than a few erst slackers out there including me to learn to actually feed themselves the next category on the forbes list is someone with a terminal professional degree like an mba phd md etc from the best school possible why because as of about the best way to get into harvard for instance is to be smart not rich don t take my word for it ask their admissions office look at the admissions stats over the years for proof meritocracy american style was invented at the ivy league after world war ii even stanford got the hint and of course chicago taught them all how right practically nobody who goes to a top american institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days unless of course their parents who couldn t afford to go there themselves got terminal degrees in the last years or so and their kids still had to get the grades and biased by intelligence test scores to get in the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with terminal degrees until they actually own something and hire people or learn to make something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis persist in the practically insane belief like life after death that economics is some kind of zero sum game that dumb people who don t work hard for it make all the money and if someone is smart works hard and is rich then they stole their wealth somehow btw none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame me for the fact that i m using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders you were apparently too dumb to grab the right end i went to missouri and i don t have a degree in anything actually useful much less a terminal one which means i m broker than anyone on this list it s just that you of all people lots with educations far surpassing my own should just plain know better the facts speak for themselves if you just open your eyes and look there are no epicycles the universe does not orbit the earth and economics is not a zero sum game the cost of anything including ignorance and destitution is the forgone alternative in this case intelligence and effort i will however admit to being educated waay past my level of competence and by the way you discuss economics so have you apparently btw if we ever actually had free markets in this country including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes all those smart people in the forbes would have more money and there would be more self made people on that list in addition most of the people who inherited money on the list would have much less of it not even relatively speaking finally practically all of that new money would have come from economic efficiency and not stolen from someone else investment bubbles or not that efficiency is called progress for those of you in the people s republics of berkeley or cambridge it means more and better stuff cheaper over time a terrible petit bourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite or you d know about it by now in economic terms it s also called an increase in general welfare and no virginia i m not talking about extorting money from someone who works and giving it to someone who doesn t in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as santa claus come election time in short then economics is not a zero sum game property is not theft the rich don t get rich off the backs of the poor and redistributionist labor
