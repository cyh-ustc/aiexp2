 david asked my wife noticed something odd the nearly full moon was about degrees above the horizon there was a notable glow on the horizon except under the moon the moon seemed to be in a column of darkness that was about three times the apparent width of the moon we could see the column over its entire length as a strip of sky darker than the sky around it any of you ever see this do you have any idea what could have caused it i suspect it s due to some pecularity of the visual system but have no clear idea bill jacobs i m surprised to not find this phenomenon in corlis i could have sworn i saw it there he does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow and a secondary bow i personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a semi circle of darker sky i know i ve read about pillars under the sun and moon elsewhere but i can t recall if they were reportedly dark or bright i do know these sorts of things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system i m sorry i haven t got any answers but a search through some books on atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up some links comprehensive http www meteoros de indexe htm atmospheric light phenomena http www auf asn au meteorology section html interesting observational stuff from the prior millenium including pix click colour plates http www ursa fi ursa jaostot halot ehp index html more pix many of which flip to negative to highlight details hover cursor http idefix taide turkuamk fi iluukkon taivas valok html and subsequent links john k yahoo groups sponsor dvds free s p join now http us click yahoo com pt ybb nxieaa mvfiaa gsolb tm to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe egroups com your use of yahoo groups is subject to http docs yahoo com info terms
