 greg in case it wasn t obvious i m a strong proponent of filtering greg junk mail as early as possible ie right after the smtp data greg command has been completed filtering spam at the mua just seems greg stupid to me by the time it gets to me mua the spammer has greg already stolen my bandwidth the two problems i see with filtering that early are everyone receiving email via that server will contribute ham to the stew making the bayesian classification less effective given that there will be some false positives you absolutely have to put the mail somewhere you can t simply delete it i also don t like the tmda ish business of replying with a msg that says here s what you do to really get your message to me that puts an extra burden on my correspondents as an individual i would prefer you put spammish messages somewhere where i can review them not an anonymous sysadmin who i might not trust with my personal email nothing against you greg i personally prefer to manage this stuff at the user agent level bandwidth is a heck of a lot cheaper than my time skip
