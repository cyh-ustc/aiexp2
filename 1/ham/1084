 the way to debug something like this is to turn on the log preferences hacking support debug log enabled and track the gpg commands being issued and the responses fwiw using exmh and gpg i do not have problems sending encrypted messages to myself when i select the message an xterm window pops up asking for the passphrase i don t recall exmh ever asking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a dialog box but then again i m not a heavy gpg user kevin in message brent welch writes hmm i m cc ing the exmh workers list because i really don t know much about the various pgp interfaces i think there has been some talk about issues with the latest version of gpg hacksaw said version linux habitrail home fools errant com smp smp thu sep edt i unknown tk tcl it s not clear to me this is a bug with exmh per se but it s something that manifests through exmh so i figured asking you might help me track it down when i receive a gpg encrypted message and it asks me for a passphrase it first tries to ask me via the tty under which exmh is running it tells me my passphrase is incorrect every time at which point exmh offers me the line in the message about decrypting i click the line and it offers me the dialog box and tells me the passphrase is correct and shows me the decrypted message any ideas on that exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
