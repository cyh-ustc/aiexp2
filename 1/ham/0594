 on monday september pm geege schuman wrote ever notice how the feelings evoked in some dreams stick with you all day i m sure it s some neurochemical process initiated during the dream that is still cycling thru like a deja vu triggered by memory processes where you don t actually remember but you feel like you re remembering absolutely and i ve wanted to recapture it i ve done some writing based on dreams and there is a mysterious mood to that feeling that drives some creative stuff for me i ve never tried to write music in that state but i will next time eirikur
