 gordon mohr it was clear you were talking about averages but it should be equally clear that that isn t what people mean when they use the word promiscuity sigh this sprung out of a report linked by cindy about the promiscuity of female monkeys with males other than the alpha male i e specifically not the tail end of the distribution by mating with as many extra group males as possible female langurs ensure etc ok then consider a population of men each pair off with women then man let s call him wilt also has sex with the other women this has never happened its relevance is nil averages are useful sure but much more so if called by their actual name rather than conflated with another concept so i chose not to type on average explicitly in my post since this is fork and one tends to assume that people have a clue there is no disagreement between us except that i am more interested in typical behaviour and you in extreme actually you probably just had a bad day and felt like jumping down my throat for the hell of it eot afaic r
