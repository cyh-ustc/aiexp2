 damn this thing is slick someone seems to have done a very complete qa test on it yesterday i installed it for the first time on an old celeron box sure parts of it were slow but compared to my more modern machine everything is it was good a beautiful interface that legions of sheep can look at and say cool i can understand this and leave their shackles behind i was struck by the massive amount of applications both kde and gnome intuitively seperated not by the gnome kde names but by their meanings instead it s obvious that someone spent a lot of time improving the usability and graphics to make it more international the web browser graphic for example has a world icon with a mouse wrapped around it office apps have familiar pens paper and or calculators involved this is a linux that i can plop down in front of almost anyone and they can figure it out at some point i d miss the character of kde gnome and i ll probably hotrod the graphics setup with my own themes etc but for the wide release this one s it if you get a chance try this i think you ll be surprisingly pleased brian fahrl nder linux zealot conservative and technomad evansville in my voyage http www countermoon com icq just machines to make big decisions programmed by fellas with compassion and vision we ll be clean when that work is done eternally free and eternally young linux rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
