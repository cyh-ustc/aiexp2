 skip montanaro wrote i actually like neale s x spam disposition header i just wonder if maybe we should choose something with a different prefix than x spam so that people don t confuse it with spamassassin all of whose headers begin with that prefix i think it s fine in general just so long as no one checks in anything that puts it into my test corpus or alternately whatever is chosen should be ignored by the tokenizer i know my mail host interlink runs sa but i also run it with my own set of rules and scores i don t want my spam filter to be getting messed up by an upstream spam filter
