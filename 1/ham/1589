 michael moncur said my corpus is about spamtrap spam at any given time let me know if i should leave that out next time i do keep it separate my spamtraps are pretty clean of viruses and bounce messages most of the time imo spamtrap data that s well cleaned and monitored is fine to my mind there s types of spamtraps old user addresses recycled into spamtraps when the user closes the account old user addresses recycled into spamtraps several months after the user closes the account scanned for newsletters unsubscribed from them etc real spamtrap addresses to trap website crawlers the latter are the most effective but is a real pita it takes lots of maintainance to avoid ham getting in there some of my spamtrap data had a few s contributed by isps and i hadn t spent enough time sifting for legit mail that was slipping through so i felt better leaving them out for this run apart from what i d hand cleaned j
