 once upon a time daniel wrote and yes i accept patches comments suggestions about all those spec files sure thing cool i ve added to the spec some flags to remove oss and isa pnp support at build time if one wishes to so is s possible to do a rpmbuild recompile without oss without isapnp ok i ll add this also having the kernel compiled by me i have no kernel source package installed i ve added a flag kernsrc that also can be used without to remove the dependency for kernel source at build time it would be nice to check the correct kernel include files actually exist lib modules uname r build include linux h though however i m a beginner in rpm building is it possible to buildrequire for a file not provided by a package at all i ve googled a bit and found no way to do that requiring a file that isn t part of an rpm is not possible no except maybe by stopping the build process if it isn t found but that s errr ugly and i really think that for people who installed a kernel from sources the easiest is to install the alsa kernel drivers from source too i was also considering adding some sort of flag for the with cards option in alsa s configure but don t know how to do that only found out about without from your first alsa driver spec and existing rpm docs don t help much this would be a tricky one since to use the with feature of rpmbuild i think you d need to add individual handling of each and every card oh and one more thing at first i ve installed the first version of alsa driver for although i don t have that kernel to supply the dependency for the rest of the alsa rpm s and compiled the modules from source it created the dev files and all that s what the alsa driver is there for create all the base files excluding the kernel drivers what i would suggest for dependency reasons it to install an alsa kernel for the original kernel you ve kept it right and install alsa modules from source for custom kernels built from source then wanted to make my own rpm for so now i m trying to rpmbuild the alsa kernel package removed all alsa rpms and tried my spec rpmbuild ba alsa driver spec mine without oss without isapnp without kernsrc but i get this long successful compile snipped rpm build errors file listed twice dev adsp file listed twice dev amidi installed but unpackaged file s found etc makedev d macros etc rc d init d alsasound oh and i think i ve forgot to mention i m running beta null indeed the rpm snapshot in null has a few new features among which having the build fail when files are present in the build root but not listed in the files section i should remove them manually as part of the build process or maybe the new exclude path to file in the files section would do but i don t know how older versions of rpm would handle it on my null build system i ve simply set the variable unpackaged files terminate build matthias matthias saou world trade center edificio norte planta system and network engineer barcelona spain electronic group interactive phone rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
