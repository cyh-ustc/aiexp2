 i m not sure if this is really a razor problem issue or a sendmail problem here s the scenario my mail server is a mhz pc funning freebsd ordinarily the machine is quite idle it supports my wife s web site with apache server running on it and a few other services jabber etc between the various members of our family we get a fair amount of email coming in mailing lists etc on occasion our dsl based isp dies for a number of hours when we get a reconnection to the internet i get a huge flow of emails coming in which are then filtered via razor as a result i will sometimes see over sendmail processes running at the same time after such an occasion the machine is then really slow i noticed that my etc procmailrc file had had no arguments associated with the call to razor check there was something in the log though to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor files so i have just added home etc razor as an argument i haven t had any down time since then so i cannot comment on whether this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount this paragraph may be an aside to my real problem the first paragraph above but i thought i should be complete in my description at any rate has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes is there perhaps a way to limit the number of sendmail processes any ideas would be welcome thanks joe joe berry joe topshot com aim joe topshot yahoo msgr joetopshot jabber joetopshot topshot com baltimore md this sf net email is sponsored by osdn tired of that same old cell phone get a new here for free https www inphonic com r asp r sourceforge refcode vs razor users mailing list razor users lists sourceforge net https lists sourceforge net lists listinfo razor users
