 hi all anyone ever try connecting at bps in linux i ve got a usr k faxmodem which is meant to connect to another same modem and i have to connect at this speed due to the nt port settings on the remote side but the modem handshake always fails at this speed the modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds bps to bps but that is no good for tx rx ing data to the remote server as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle bps note minicom fails to handshake at bps but hyperterm in windows worked first time any ideas baud data bits even parity i am doing a atz to reset the modem then i send this init string at f e v q x y s a b c d h i k m n p r s u y which is most of the defaults usr said to set s disables v set s disable v x but the s just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving up btw this is a bank s system i am connecting to so reconfiguring their modems may be difficult colin colin nevin software engineer merit solutions ltd dublin goatstown cross dublin printed using recycled electrons irish linux users group ilug linux ie http www linux ie mailman listinfo ilug for un subscription information list maintainer listmaster linux ie
