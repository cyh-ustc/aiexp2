 a adam l beberg writes a i m not displeased you re trying to help just frustrated that a employers can demand such rediculous combinations of skills a with insane years of experience from my years in the playing field imho the art of job hunting for those not yet de jobbed is the art of getting past the hr stage interview and into the engineer to engineer interview hr is not being honest with you so there s no ethical quandry to be totally honest with them if they want experience numbers that would place you in the oak project lead them to believe that you have something roughly equivalent ie it wasn t years but it was three intense years with plenty of overtime they are playing a bluff in saying they know the job requirements so you re perfectly within poker rules to bluff back to say you have it if you don t have the requisite right stuff the engineers can usually suss it out pretty fast during the second interview most often their choice is based on who can i work with and only maybe on how much little will we have to tutor this candidate gary lawrence murphy teledynamics communications inc business advantage through community software http www teledyn com computers are useless they can only give you answers pablo picasso
