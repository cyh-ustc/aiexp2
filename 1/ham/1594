 http www hughes family org bugzilla show bug cgi id additional comments from easmith beatrice rutgers edu i like this idea but from my reading part of my dissertation research on gas or in this case more precisely evolutionary programming since the parameters are non binary and the major operator is mutation not crossover you do need to keep in mind that the more interactions there are between different variables the better tweaked the ga ea will need to be especially to avoid local optima which may have been the problem with the suspiciously high anti ratware user agent scores from past results what s needed are one or more of the below a determine mutational parameters by adapted scores themselves with variation on a per original score basis ideally allow for having correlated mutations in other words have a mechanism in place for trying out changes to a bunch of scores at once with them all moving about the same amount albeit possibly in different directions one means to do this is found in the evolutionary strategies of schwefel b adapt the probability of a mutation taking place depending on how well previous mutation tries have done if more than about a fifth of the new individuals are doing about as well as or better than the parental generation then mutate more parameters if less than a fifth of them are doing about as well as or better than the parental generation then mutate less parameters allen you are receiving this mail because you are the assignee for the bug or are watching the assignee this sf net email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven http thinkgeek com sf spamassassin devel mailing list spamassassin devel lists sourceforge net https lists sourceforge net lists listinfo spamassassin devel
