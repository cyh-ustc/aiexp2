 on wed oct at pm matthias saou wrote so i ve attached a patch to specify an alternate kernel by setting the target kernel environment variable before running rpmbuild you still need to have the rpm for the specified kernel installed but at least it doesn t have to be currently running it s kinda hackish so if someone has a better way to do this let me know that idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more what you sent doesn t support packages named kernel smp i d also prefer a cleaner way than the env variable and preferrably not editing the spec probably define target xx xx with smp sound good enough the buildrequires on kernel source will also need to be removed because it won t necessarily need to be true and that does bug me a bit the define is exactly what i was looking for i was trying to figure out a way to do it within the mechanism of rpm like the with switches but for some reason didn t think of using define my computer is currently gone for repairs but once it s back i ll rewrite the specfile add support for kernel smp and email it to the list for further criticism as far as requiring kernel source i don t feel it s a big problem if you re gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms it s not a far stretch to package the source tree too as i currently do also i ve found that the alsa driver source needs a usb related patch to compile under the latest test kernels prex are other people seeing the same thing or is this just a problem with my setup gary p s if i didn t mention it before thanks for the alsa packages they greatly simplified what used to take way too long before rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
