 on mon at matthias saou wrote i ve never heard of any cd rom or dvd rom drive having problems with dma although there probably is since red hat decided to default disabling it a few releases back heh i get to see bad cdrom problems all the time mostly when vendors buy crap cables to try to save each but there are chipsets and drives with known dma issues as well normally even if you try to enable dma and your device doesn t support it it simply don t be able to make the change and that s it the problem iirc is with crappy hardware that is supposed to support dma but doesn t work as expected when it s enabled maybe chris could confirm this usually if you enable dma on a cdrom that can t handle it gracefully you won t be able to read data off it relably and that s about it no end of the world problems and easily fixed i guess i ll settle for the dev dvd link change as described and putting the dma tip in the description my biggest beef with automatically setting dev dvd is that i always seem to have a cd burner and a dvd drive or dvd burner in the same box and i usually have the dvd as the second drive dev cdrom in kudzu speak i agree that the description is the best place for the tip unless someone can come up with a way to probe cd dvd drives to divulge their largest supported media size without loading ide scsi or having that media currently in the drive chris kloiber rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
