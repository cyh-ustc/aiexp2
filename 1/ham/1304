 once upon a time ben wrote i use a mostly red hat system but prefer to configure and build my kernel by hand i d like to humbly offer a tweak to alsa driver spec that helps it build cleanly under such circumstances i recognize that freshrpms net packages are designed with standard red hat in mind including a standard kernel rpm however i hope that matthias will consider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation well i don t really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package built against something that wasn t installed through rpm what i d recommend in your case you should keep at least one original red hat linux kernel you do just in case right and install the matching alsa kernel package as you ll need at least one because of the dependencies then for your custom built kernel simply configure with cards all make make install destdir tmp alsa driver from the alsa driver sources then as root copy all the modules under tmp alsa driver lib modules to your modules dir and run depmod a of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un needed drivers as i guess that s one of the reasons one would rebuild his own kernel i find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem it s what i ve done and what i ll keep doing on my laptop where i m running a kernel recompiled with acpi matthias clean custom red hat linux rpm packages http freshrpms net red hat linux release valhalla running linux kernel acpi load rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
