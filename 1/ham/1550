 on wednesday september cet justin mason wrote malte s stretz said i think we should even add new ga d rules to x and or remove old ones and tag a new only if we have a bunch of features worth a dangerous big update i d say yes you should expect and also but update to now i would think adding new rules to or removing broken rules from x would require some discussion first but new ga d scores are definitely worth putting in as the ones there are too wild i think my mail wasn t very clear my point was that we should continue releasing new rules and removing broken ones all based on discussions on this list of course in the branch instead of creating a new branch everytime we have a bunch of new rules a new branch should be openend only if big new features are introduced eg bayes or the interface has changed spam level char x as the rules are under fluent development the user has to update quite regularly but currently he couldn t be shure if the new release will break anything in his setup like f going away so if we say the branches are stable to the outside and just improved under the surface but you have to watch out when you update to a new minor version number users and sysadmins could be less reluctant to update all just imho o malte p s i ll be away from my box and my mail account for one week starting tomorrow so happy coding for the next week coding is art
