 i ve been testing razor invoked from sendmail procmail and so far it seems pretty copacetic last night s spam to the list provided a good test the spam itself as well as several of the responses were flagged as other list members reported this morning i piped the messages out from pine being careful to use the raw mode to razor check d none of the messages come back as spam even the spam since folks revoked the false positives i understand why they would not come up but not the spam itself unless that also was revoked is this spam just a bad one to test against or is there some setting in pine or razor that i am missing sc this sf net email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven http thinkgeek com sf razor users mailing list razor users lists sourceforge net https lists sourceforge net lists listinfo razor users
