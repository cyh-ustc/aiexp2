 i d prefer to strip html tags from everything but last time i tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora your corpora are biased in this respect though newsgroups have a strong social taboo on posting html but in many people s personal inboxes it is quite abundant getting a good ham corpus may prove to be a bigger hurdle than i though my own saved mail doesn t reflect what i receive since i save and throw away selectively much more so than in the past multipart mixed text plain brief text plus url s text html long html copied from website ah that explains why the html tags didn t get stripped i d again offer to add an optional argument to tokenize so that they d get stripped here too but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like a loss i ll bite sounds like a good idea to strip the html in this case i d like to see how this improves the f p rate on this corpus guido van rossum home page http www python org guido
