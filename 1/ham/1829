 brad clements just curious if subject line capitalization can be used as an indicator either the percentage of characters that are caps or percentage starting with a capital letter if number of words xx supply a mod to tokenizer py and i ll test it eventually note that the tokenizer already preserves case in subject line words because experiment showed that this was better than folding case away in this specific context but experiment also showed against my expectations that preserving case everywhere didn t make a significant difference to either error rate the subject line is a special case for this
