 date thu aug from chris garrigues message id hmmm i assume you re going to report this to the nmh folks it turns out when i did some investigation that my memory of how mh worked here was wrong that s not unusual the seq switch seems to have always done nolist requiring a subsequent list to turn it on again given that i have no idea how the pick code as it was ever worked in fact it quite possibly never did the way it was intended to i have just been browsing the sources and that seems to be attempting to do things that i never saw happen it may be that your new sequence method just exposed the bug that had been there all along given this i won t be sending any bug reports to the nmh people if nmh ever seems to be showing any signs further progress and if i remember this then i might send them a change request the code to make the change is trivial kre exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
