 on sat at gregory alan bolcer wrote there s been well documented articles studies of the french tax laws corporate governance and financial oversight that dont easily allow for isos the root of almost all entrepreneurialship and the easy flow of capital to new ventures it was an extremely large issue even debated widely in france it is actually a lot worse than this what it boils down to is that only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company what i found fascinating is that the old french aristocracy effectively still exists literally the same families but they now hold top executive and management positions in the major french firms and the government positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods not officially of course but as a strict matter of practice and the laws and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place even for a young french blue blood strict age hierarchies keep them from branching out into a new venture in their own country though many can leverage this to start companies in other countries i know about the french system first hand and the executives are quite candid about it at least to yanks like me who are working with them but i suspect this may hold true for other european countries as well after all those revolutions france is still nothing more than a thinly veiled old school aristocracy with all the trappings james rogers jamesr best com
