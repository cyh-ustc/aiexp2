 the historical record by which you mean human historical record is highly overrated nigh worthless when you are talking about geological timescales even on topics with as short a timescale as climate my problem with global warming or cooling for that matter is that the supposedly profound recent changes in temperature both in absolute terms and as a function time very arguably fall well below the noise floor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rate of temperature change people unfamiliar with history of global temperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degree here or there over a century is a lot not realizing that global temperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity i therefore immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain why temperatures whipsawed more severely in pre history than in the last couple thousand years which have been relatively calm by geological standards this is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to use climate to push a particular social agenda it is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited during the last major ice age they are finding substantial evidence of humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers paved over their civilization the receding glaciers have turned into a bit of an archaeological treasure chest as they expose artifacts buried in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the ice for thousands of years i don t see any compelling reason to save the glaciers anyway particularly in light of the fact that their existence has always been transient for anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another i ll just stick with occam s razor for now in my humble opinion cheers james rogers jamesr best com on mon at jim whitehead wrote for anyone to fully bury global warming they would need to explain why the dramatic increase in co concentrations are not increasing the global temperature they would also need to explain why worldwide glaciers are melting faster than they have previously in the historical record that is people need more than refutations they need a compelling alternate explanation hint climate variability doesn t cover all the bases
