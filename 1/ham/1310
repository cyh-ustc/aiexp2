 once upon a time angles wrote when i went all open source i stopped using my old partioning app partition magic for the rh install i used fips a couple times then ext came out and my old commercial partioning app is real old so i ask what os software can non destructively repartition a hd so i can put home on a seperate partition now parted is your friend you can t do everything the most limiting being that you can t move the start of a partition but it s quite powerful nevertheless and i ve been very happy with it the few times i ve had to use it if you didn t put home on a separate partition with winbloze x i used to deltree the winbloze dir and some program files dirs and install fresh instead of upgrade while saving my other data can this trick be used with this rh upgrade example rpm e everything so all packages are gone hit reset button and boot to redhat cdrom in admin rescue mode delete all those config files left like etc then do an install but not format that single partition that i m installing on if i can hack the details is this theory accurate or will rh want to destructively install and elimate all existing files you re really better off backuping all placed where you know you ve hand edited or installed some files for me that s only etc root and home then you reinstall cleanly formating put your home files back into place and you re ready to go that s the moment i usually realize i had a nifty tweak to a file in etc sysconfig network scripts or some special parameters added to an etc modules conf entry so i look at my backup and make the same change again the only thing where you can get stuck is the grub conf files because although there s a etc grub conf link it s actually in boot grub so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel parameters to save i have to pass pci bios biosirq for one of my computers to work for example hth matthias matthias saou world trade center edificio norte planta system and network engineer barcelona spain electronic group interactive phone rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
