 mf i don t think free speech is a license to speak directly at and be in the mf physical presence of any particular individual of your choosing especially mf when that individual is busy doing something else and isn t interested yep i agree sure and that goes back to my second argument cohen they can walk away nobody compells them to stand there i ll agree fully but we still have a constitutional right to speak out against policies actions and grievances again if you want it another way lets change the constitution huh are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship if shouting down public speakers is protected it is only a matter of time before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against them every single time they open their mouth the tactic is stupid and non productive and if generally used will only result in chaos the tactic is just stupid ego bation at best unless the goal is to generate chaos and humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society should be locked up provided you can accurately identify them which is not really possible anyway but hey this is my rant imho bill
