 for example take the recent cbc olympics site i needed to roll together a telnet client with a tokenizer perl regex preprocessing a stream to produce parseable xml project that xml into relational databases using only the dtd to generate the rdbms schema and open an xmlrpc interface to read and post items into the news stream where can i find c libs for those components you open sourced the new components you developed for this project so the next person who comes along won t have to reimplement them right jim
