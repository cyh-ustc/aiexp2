 from owen byrne a flippant remark that i will probably regret sure there s assholes everywhere i just remember a lunch in spain with a semi famous american i think we had about nationalities at the table and he managed to insult each of them within minutes a historical perspective makes me think that empires roman british russian american whatever produce a larger proportion of assholes than subject nations and are more likely to have them in positions of authority yep those that win battles collect tthe spoils lead and breed want it to be different lead don t whine
