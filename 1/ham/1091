 on fri sep at robert elz wrote date wed sep from brent welch exmh has a funky cut paste model that is essentially all my fault the middle click sets the insert point if you hate that go to the bindings simple edit preferences window and de select paste sets insert unfortunately the side effect of that solution is that it is no longer possible to cut paste within one sedit window some intermediate client always must be used except in the rare case where you want to select some text and then paste it at the same place so the vast majority of people probably want that paste sets insert enabled that one you can learn to live with the other is much more painful for a long time i have used an external editor with exmh gvim i can cut n paste from exmh s message display window into spawned gvim processes but not into anything else this is very annoying i have to look at the message with cat or less or whatever in a terminal window if i want to do this which is quite often and if the message is q p encoded or a non text plain mime type i end up with all that raw garbage too anyway to fix this btw standard i redhat thanks kre cheers tony exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
