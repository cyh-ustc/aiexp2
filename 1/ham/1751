 did you want this on the list i m replying to the list on sep at guido van rossum wrote what s an auto ham automatically marking something as ham after a given timeout regardless of how long that timeout is someone is going to forget to submit the message back as spam how many spams as hams can be accepted before the f n rate gets unacceptable how about adding an imap server with a spam and deleted ham folder most email clients can handle imap users should be able to quickly move spam into the spam folder i personally don t think imap has a bright future but for people who do use it that s certainly a good approach instead of deleting messages or by reprogramming the delete function they can quickly move ham into the ham folder yes i view imap as a stop gap measure until tighter integration with various email clients can be achieved i still feel it s better to require classification feedback from the recipient rather than make any assumptions after some period of time passes but this is an end user issue and we re still at the algorithm stage brad clements bkc murkworks com http www murkworks com fax aol im bkclements
