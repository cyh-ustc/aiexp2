 i m a very happy user of exmh but i m paranoid also therefore i m not too happy with exmh caching my pgp passphrases usually i use a relatively secure tool called quintuple agent to store my passphrases and i ve just added the few lines of code to exmh which allow for such external caches the patch is attached it is against version debian and the files modified are extrasinit tcl and pgpexec tcl i ve added three new preferences in the general pgp section which allow everybody to use his her favourite external tool to get the passphrase everything which spits out the phrase on stdout is ok i d be happy if somebody with cvs access thinks that this stuff is worth to be added and does so apart from that i m happy for suggestions comments or critique mind you i m not exactly a special friend of tcl so my code may leave things to be desired regards az exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
