 date wed aug from chris garrigues message id so i ll probably poke around at the sequences performance issues well there s this wonderful piece of code in mhseqexpand hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that don t exist foreach m rseq if file exists mhprofile path folder m exmh debug mhprofile path folder m not found set ix lsearch seq m set seq lreplace seq ix ix else real hack break which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch of messages that don t exist i m not sure why it is important that the first message in the sequence returned exists but not necessarily any of the others but i m sure glad it is as mhseqexpand gets called lots and i don t know if i could cope if it were checking every file in the sequences it is looking at all the time it may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current folder though that would then need to be verified against changes to the directory does tcl have a directory read function i assume so mh sequence also goes and rereads the files mh sequences and the context file but i m not sure how frequently that one is called i ll email anything i figure out since i m leaving town in less than hours have a good vacation kre exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
