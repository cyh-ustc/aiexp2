 date thu aug from chris garrigues message id hmmm i assume you re going to report this to the nmh folks yes i will sometime after i look at the nmh sources and see what they have managed to break and why but we really want exmh to operate with all the versions of nmh that exist don t we the patch to have exmh do the right thing whether this bug exists or not is trivial so i d suggest including it patch follows i have no idea why the sequences were being added after the message list before not that it should make any difference to nmh or mh but since i stopped doing that the variable msgs isn t really needed any more rather than assigning pick msgs to msgs and then using msgs the code could just use pick msgs where msgs is now used this is just a frill though so i didn t change that kre pick tcl fri aug usr local lib exmh pick tcl sat aug proc pick it global pick exmh set cmd list exec pick exmh folder list set cmd list exec pick exmh folder set inpane set hadpane for set pane pane
