 for anyone to fully bury global warming they would have to bury the greens a green once said that if the spotted owl hadn t existed they would have had to invent it so it is with global warming their fundamental opposition isn t to a warmer earth it is to industrial civilization the fact that the sattelites didn t match what the global warming theorists said should be there is old news the news here is that the temperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have been validated with a different means of measurement rather than have to defend co concentrations as not causing global warming people who believe in co need a good explanation of the medieval warm period said period was warmer than what we have now and it obvioiusly wasn t caused by co in point of fact the predicted global warming due to co is not caused directly by co co doesn t trap that much heat water vapor does and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to co then you have your warming theory yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth s climate over long periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback loops but one where negative feedback loops predominate more water vapor can increase temperatuers but that also leads to more clouds clouds both trap heat and reflect it so it depends a great deal on how the cloud formation shakes out most climate models admit they do clouds very poorly a good link is http www techcentralstation be wrapper jsp pid cid a original message from fork admin xent com mailto fork admin xent com on behalf of jim whitehead sent monday september pm to robert harley fork example com subject re goodbye global warming gary lawrence murphy wrote and say hello to the cool oooo this is going to cause some stir of course not some people just don t want to be confused by the facts for anyone to fully bury global warming they would need to explain why the dramatic increase in co concentrations are not increasing the global temperature they would also need to explain why worldwide glaciers are melting faster than they have previously in the historical record that is people need more than refutations they need a compelling alternate explanation hint climate variability doesn t cover all the bases jim
