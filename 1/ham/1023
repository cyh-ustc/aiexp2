 begin forwarded message from ian andrew bell date wed oct pm us pacific to mike michaelmoore com cc foib ianbell com subject politicos re bowling for columbine opens this friday michael why is it that people who consider voting in an election an inconvenience would go to see a movie to show support for its message don t get me wrong i think this is the case people will go to see your movie as much to be entertained and informed as they will to express their malice and discontent towards not only the present regime in america but also the corrupt empty shallow pantomime which cast them into power in reality today the voting that takes place via the act of consumption far outweighs the impact caused by people going to a booth and dimpling the appropriate chad or some other such convoluted act of free democratic expression why because in america they believe in dollars dollars don t lie in practise they are the last frontier of truth in america universally accepted as expressions of fear desire passion and need compared to the swing of the almighty buck and jeb bush knows this a hanging chad has only the nethermost meaning given that fact i modestly propose an entirely new though wholly logical extension to the current democratic system in place in america i propose we augment and effectively replace the electoral system with a political stock market we should accept that politicians are entrepreneurs just like any other businessperson in america and embrace this fact in building an economic system which truly reflects their intent a politician should issue a constant number of shares dependent upon his tenure in government those shares should be traded on an open exchange say the g r e e d short of course for the global realists electoral exchange democratic politicians we believe in will see their stocks rise higher as faith in their ability to maintain office grows as the truth about their embezzling campaign funds for weekend trips to maui with their interns is revealed of course their fortunes will fall this represents an opportunity for the market forces those same forces which you intend to harness to express your own personal protest to voice their opinion on the quality of america s governance during the intervening four years between elections elections themselves will in effect become meaningless as they are now since their outcome will be influenced by the stock price of each and every congressman senator and presidential candidate just think of the coverage that could be given on msnbc strom thurman strom news quotes was down today on fears that his latest heart operation will render him unable to attend senate armed services committee meetings until november this would provide rejuvenating content to the econo political news sector which has found post economic bubble coverage to be both tiresome and deoressing the establishment of this new stock exchange would of course create jobs for newly unemployed and governmentally retrained it systems engineers who could after passing the electoral securities exam become floor traders this would also allow for a convenient and very public method by which candidates could raise capital in the public markets to support their multi billion dollar campaigns the requirement for the support of legions of spin doctors permanent campaign managers and investor relations personnel would also create jobs perhaps even a new practice for ernst young arthur anderson et al insider trading scandals and misleading revenue declarations would of course catch martha stewart as an unwitting beneficiary thus spreading her influence to politics dividends if there are any on record at the close of a politician s career could be paid to current shareholders based on the holdings pensions funds could provide the institutional investment support necessary to underpin even the biggest dogs among the beltway set union funds brokerages and even pump and dump houses could benefit from meteoric rises in conservative candidates running in the southeast and the bush governmet would be allowed to place social security bets where they really mattered investors who lose their retirement life savings and support could rest assured that they were indeed robbed by crooks rather than poor investors although there s no way to protect any of these for worldcom like crashes ambitious inspired district attorneys could file criminal suits against candidates and campaign managers who underperform expectations thus assuring investors that their logic was not faulty instead they were merely defrauded by crooks and thieves on the whole i believe the system could work i could certainly work as well as our beloved securities trading industry and given the american electoral system s success at effectively expressing the will of the people it certainly couldn t do any worse in the meantime mike i think i ll go see your movie and try to depose the president ian on wednesday october at pm michael moore s mailing list wrote october my film bowling for columbine opens this friday dear friends fans and fellow evildoers i am very happy and excited to tell you that this friday october my new film bowling for columbine will open in new york and los angeles it is i promise the last thing the bushies want projected on the movie screens across america this week the film is first and foremost a devastating indictment of the violence that is done in our name for profit and power and no one in all the advance screenings i have attended has left the theatre with anything short of rage i truly believe this film has the potential to rock the nation and get people energized to do something this is not good news for junior and company not when they are trying to drag us into another war not when a crazed sniper is exercising his constitutional right to own a high powered rifle not when john ashcroft is still prohibiting the fbi from looking through the gun background check files to see if any of the hijackers or their associates purchased any weapons prior to because that we are told would violate these terrorists sacred second amendment rights yes i believe this movie can create a lot of havoc but i will need all of you to help me do this are you game last february th i wrote to tell you about a book i had written and how the publisher had decided to dump it because they were afraid to publish anything critical of bush after i appealed to you to save stupid white men from the shredder and to go out and buy it i promised you would not regret it and that the book would not only be a great read but an important organizing tool in gumming up the plans of george w bush within hours the book went to on the amazon best seller list by the fifth day the book was already into its th printing the publisher was torn between its desire to kill the book or make a wad of money greed won out and this sunday the book enters its st week on the new york times best seller list and its nd printing this is all because of you my crazy and loyal friends you made this happen against all the odds now i would like to ask you again to help me with my latest work bowling for columbine it s a movie that many critics have already called my best film to date they may be right it is certainly the most provocative thing i have ever done i have spent three years on it and i have to say it cuts deeper harder and funnier that anything i have given you so far the movie opens this friday in new york and los angeles and then in more cities next week how it does in these first ten cities will determine whether or not the rest of the country gets to see it that is the nutty way our films are released if it doesn t have a big opening weekend you can kiss the film good bye therefore this weekend this film must be seen by millions of americans can you help me make that happen bowling for columbine is not a film simply about guns or school shootings that is only the starting point for my hour journey into the dark soul of a country that is both victim and master of an enormous amount of violence both at home and around the world with this movie i have broadened my canvas to paint a portrait of our nation at the beginning of the st century a nation that seems hell bent on killing first and asking questions later it is a movie about the state sponsored acts of violence and terrorism against our own poor and how we have created a culture of fear that is based on the racial dilemma we continue to ignore and it s a devastating comedy this film is going to upset some pretty big apple carts no film has ever said the things i am saying in bowling for columbine i expect to be attacked i expect certain theatres will not show it for fear of retribution i expect that this movie will be a bitter pill for many to swallow this is why i need your help movies live or die based on what happens at the box office the first weekend of its release i need you if you live in the new york or l a area to go see bowling for columbine this friday and saturday and take as many family members and friends with you as possible i guarantee you will not be disappointed and you may just see one of the best films of the year monday night in times square bowling for columbine had its premiere the crowd was amazing as it was this past saturday night at the chicago film festival the audience kept laughing or hooting or applauding so loud throughout the film that it was hard to hear the next line the hate mail the threats the promises of retribution have already started to roll in to the distributor of this movie united artists they are not backing down but how long will this last i need all of you in the new york tri state and southern california areas to go see bowling for columbine this weekend the rest of you can see it in a couple of weeks when it comes to your town a strong opening not only means that the rest of america will see this film it means that a good number of people who see it are going to leave the film angry enough to get active and get involved if it does poorly i will have a difficult time finding the funding for the movie i want to make next a film about and how bush is using that tragic day as a cover for his right wing agenda don t let that happen don t let the nra have one more success by stopping the wider distribution of this movie and together let us not remain silent in our opposition to bush s phony war against iraq if you live in new york you can see it at the lincoln plaza the sunshine and the loews th st in l a you can catch it at the sunset the westwood regent laemmle sunset laemmle towncenter encino landmark rialto pasadena and regal university irvine also please forward this to your
