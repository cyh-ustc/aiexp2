 exmh p content type text plain charset us ascii from robert elz date sat aug date thu aug from chris garrigues message id hmmm i assume you re going to report this to the nmh folks yes i will sometime after i look at the nmh sources and see what they have managed to break and why but we really want exmh to operate with all the versions of nmh that exist don t we the patch to have exmh do the right thing whether this bug exists or not is trivial so i d suggest including it patch follows i have no idea why the sequences were being added after the message list before not that it should make any difference to nmh or mh but since i stopped doing that the variable msgs isn t really needed any more rather than assigning pick msgs to msgs and then using msgs the code could just use pick msgs where msgs is now used this is just a frill though so i didn t change that i ll fix this in cvs this afternoon thanks chris chris garrigues http www deepeddy com cwg vircio http www vircio com congress suite austin tx world war iii the wrong doers vs the evil doers exmh p content type application pgp signature begin pgp signature version gnupg v gnu linux comment exmh version id dbqe ajtdk b h r iuiralfjakcjrcakr dkmh oqhfkagdddfmrbwcdh vv fcrluseu edqaod ycwodq lzs end pgp signature exmh p exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
