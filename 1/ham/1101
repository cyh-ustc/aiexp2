 in message tony nu gent writes i have set my right mouse button to move a message to another folder which works fine however link also uses the same destination folder as move and so if i want to use link i first have to mark the destination folder with a message move undo the move then i can use the link very inconvenient is there a better way for me to set this up so that link works with one or two simple clicks according to some old documentation man exmh ref the mouse bindings for the folders labels are left change to folder middle view nested folders right refile current messages to the folder shift right link current messages to the folder shift middle drag a folder label to some drop target control right clear the current target folder it should be possible to link using shift right click the same way you can move using only right click kevin exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
