 exmh p content type text plain charset us ascii from robert elz date wed aug date wed aug from chris garrigues message id so i ll probably poke around at the sequences performance issues well there s this wonderful piece of code in mhseqexpand hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that don t exist foreach m rseq if file exists mhprofile path folder m exmh debug mhprofile path folder m not found set ix lsearch seq m set seq lreplace seq ix ix else real hack break which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch of messages that don t exist i m not sure why it is important that the first message in the sequence returned exists but not necessarily any of the others but i m sure glad it is as mhseqexpand gets called lots and i don t know if i could cope if it were checking every file in the sequences it is looking at all the time although my fingerprints are all over that it s not actually my code and has been in there since before it s code that i moved from mh tcl to sequences tcl and back again i m no sure either but it should be a one time penalty because the sequence will be re written with the bad messages removed i think it may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current folder though that would then need to be verified against changes to the directory does tcl have a directory read function i assume so mh sequence also goes and rereads the files mh sequences and the context file but i m not sure how frequently that one is called that was a problem but if you look at mh sequence and mh sequences and mh sequenceupdate they all call mhreadseqs to do the actual reading and it only reads the sequences if the file has been touched look for the exmh debug reading filename output in the debug log to see when sequences are actually reread from disk my theory is that ftoc showsequences is being called too often i m about to investigate that i ll email anything i figure out since i m leaving town in less than hours have a good vacation thanks chris chris garrigues http www deepeddy com cwg vircio http www vircio com congress suite austin tx world war iii the wrong doers vs the evil doers exmh p content type application pgp signature begin pgp signature version gnupg v gnu linux comment exmh version id dbqe bo pk b h r iuiraqbbaj uhmwlotb ssg jdwcm ul rvdegcfe no ohnblg unfwmlqoasidza ra end pgp signature exmh p exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
