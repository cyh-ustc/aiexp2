 justin mason writes has anyone figured out what s up with this does someone out there think that fork needs some mime tutoring i was puzzled at first but i think i understand what happened first i approved the post because it didn t appear to be spam even though it wasn t from a member i thought it was odd that someone wanted to send the mime blurb to the list but it was not really that different from causing the new york times web site to send a story to the list except that the bits here are antediluvian but old bits are a problem to be solved by social opporobrium not technical constraints but i think what actually happened is that some idiot got infected by klez and had both fork and the pine robot autoresponder address in their mailbox or addressbook so klez forged mail from fork xent com to the autoresponder which responded to fork
