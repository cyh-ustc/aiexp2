 once upon a time joshua wrote just a thought would it be possible to generalize this alsa stuff to make building a kernel with any custom optional updated modules an easy thing i think some scripts or at least step by step instructions would be great for example to build a kernel rpm with alsa do get the kernel source get the alsa source run the custom kernel sh script or a kernel rpm with the lastest wireless lan drivers get the kernel source get the cvs driver source run the custom kernel sh script etc this wouldn t be worth the effort involved imho and would probably end up in relative breakage of a few systems if not carefully tested your first example is a good one because i really think it s even easier currently leave your current kernel as is get the alsa driver source rpm rebuild and install resulting packages drivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules like ltmodem nvidia alsa etc can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm also what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in my mind i see it more as a one size fits all achievement in the general case and kernel isn t an exception although there are packages optimized for various processors since they all come with just about all the modules you ll ever need make that one size fits many then if you want last but not least the kernel is something i m trying to keep away from in my packaging since i really don t want to see newbies screwing up their systems because of packages on my website same goes for gnome kde and other major bits of the distribution since i also want people who happily use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next red hat linux release without having their system turned into another ximian mess matthias ps yes chris i m worried about not giving you too much work less in fact since you can easily answer freshrpms net to people asking how to play dvds right matthias saou world trade center edificio norte planta system and network engineer barcelona spain electronic group interactive phone rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
