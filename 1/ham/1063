 i am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry standards i use it for my personal mail my mail server runs unix and i connect over ssh and tunnel my x traffic over ssh with a slow link this makes exmh very slow and mime handling is pretty bad compared with modern mailers these are some good comments and i d like to share an opinion here is that permitted i started using linux about or years ago in rebellion against what the university was doing with winder i just couldn t get good support and was using a lot of unix based tools ported to winder anyway so i jumped ship and became my own sysadm what i got was the easy ability to use a shell now ssh to connect to my office box from just about anywhere and use either exmh or nmh from the command line i can do email for the office fairly easily i haven t seen any other tools that let me do that yet but i have to admit that some of the web based mail software is getting pretty close quoting and such is still primitive but they re moving forward d exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
