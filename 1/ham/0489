 e elias sinderson writes e the strength to weight ratio of a spider is so high e that spiderman is able to throw a bus several city blocks with e little effort his endurance is similarly enhanced as well could this be as simple as a modified molecular structure where the humanoid cells are in fact exo skeletally structured with more atoms per cubic angstrom to achieve the distance squared tensile strength enhancements we find when we introduce smaller metal atoms between the lattice packed grid of iron atoms to create steel this steel effect might give bone structure and tendons dramatically several orders of magnitude more tensile strength without the need to significantly increase the weight like magnesium alloy or carbon fiber weight compared to iron spidey could even be way under weight only increasing tensile strength could accommodate the mobility and leverage feats since bones are actually formed from bubbles of organic material hydrolically assisted tensile strength cross sectionally would give his frame the strength to withstand the muscular enhancement e as for the spidey senses well they re really great but afaik e not really well explained in the comic series if the same close packing gap filling arachne molecular structure modification occurs in neural tissues and there d be no reason to think that these would grow differently from bones and tendons then what we are seeing in spidey sense is no more than the heightened cerebral functions due to shorter faster stronger synapses throughout the entire nervous system since we know dogs and cats measure human emotions by smell clearly hearing the heartbeats and other subtle clues within their normal sensory ranges but seem mystical to us for peter parker everything from air currents on his facial hairs to extremely subtle hormone smells might coallesce into a general gestalt of spidey sense don t forget that he d acquired this ability in adolescence and thus would lack any cultural or even pathological basis to explain the heightened awareness to himself in anything but mystical terms we know from issue that his collision avoidance reflex response time was far swifter than his cognitive awareness since he found himself already stuck to the tree when the bicycle was already past and hence his disorientation you ok mister as if it was a hallucination hmmm it may even be physio psychologically interesting to examine if peter parker s personal quandries arose because his physiological spidey infrastructure had been advanced whereas his psychological perception of his self had not ie peter was not spiderman but just the driver of the bus only unlike ourselves he found his self driving a body vehicle not evolutionarily matched to his cognitive time scales gary lawrence murphy teledynamics communications inc business advantage through community software http www teledyn com computers are useless they can only give you answers pablo picasso
