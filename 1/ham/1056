 i use exmh with procmail for presorting incoming mail and move it to the relevant folder using rcvstore recently my incoming mail or spool location moved to another disk i m not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail rcvstore exmh to accept mail from the new location there seems to be a variable in exmh defaults bgspool it says at the top of the file not to edit these lines so i went ahead and edited it that does not make a difference it seems like procmail is the one that is actually reading the mail from my spool incoming mail area and piping it to rcvstore so i need to configure that probably any idea how i would do this thanks siva exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
