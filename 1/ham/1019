 i m not sure what you mean by let s you and him fight but it is important to remember that england was in control of ireland for years exactly let s you and him fight is a way of dealing with troublesome populations by moving them next to one another so they give each other and not the man grief so by my understanding and you all will understand with tongue firmly in cheek ireland irish uppity barbarians overly fond of risings scots more uppity barbarians overly fond of risings why not plonk down a bunch of the latter next to the former and kill two birds with one stone israel ex ottomans uppity barbarians didn t they help kick out the ottomans zionists uppity sorts who aren t happy with perfectly good land in uganda why not plonk down a bunch of the latter next to the former and kill two birds with one stone but not india in which the muslims and hindus were originally intermixed to some degree but partioned due to their own conflict not due to english resettlement policy canada in which the french and english were already established and it was just the balance of power on the continent that determined events in the colonies the acadians got resettled but they don t seem to have been that good for picking fights with their neighbors so no one had them plonked down next door dave this works best with a populace who given one man one vote immediately deduce one less man one less vote eh magnan
