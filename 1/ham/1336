 matthias saou matthias rpmforge net wrote i really think that with my alsa packages alsa on red hat linux has never been so easy i had been hand building those alsa packages for probably months or more so i could use my laptop s ess chip best hard disk recording and such wow maybe to months time flys i didn t look forward to doing that tedious build every time i changed a kernel or something matthias has made this a thing of the past dude it s a no brainer use apt get or just download and install what s more oss is fully imitated older apps using oss are as happy as a clam my personal taste tells me newer apps which use alsa sound better alsaplayer xmms with alsa module to my ear the things that trick people are the modules conf file they didn t have that automatic matrix page when i started with alsa you don t know how good you have it and on my old installs only the first time i installed it on a clean box alsa always was muted until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music it s possible matthias even took care of that too anyway it is was only a one time thing on st install that was a long time ago for me those alsa dudes had been trying to get it into the kernel but missed it but it s been in for a while now so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel that s angle as in geometry rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
