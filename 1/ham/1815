 guido on the classifier pickle on sf i downloaded and played with it a bit but had no time to do anything systematic cool it correctly recognized a spam that slipped through sa ditto but it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any mime structure or html parts and several messages in my saved zope geeks list that happened to be using mime and or html do you know why the strangest implied claim there is that it hates mime independent of html for example the spamprob of content type text plain in that pickle is under content type multipart alternative gets but that s not a killer clue and one bit of good content will more than cancel it out wrt hating html possibilities include it really had to do with something other than mime html these are pure html not multipart alternative with a text plain part so that the tags aren t getting stripped the pickled classifier despises all hints of html due to its c l py heritage these are multipart alternative with a text plain part but the latter doesn t contain the same text as the text html part for example as anthony reported perhaps the text plain part just says something like this is an hmtl message if it s it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize meaning even if it is pure html strip the tags anyway in fact i d like to do that and default it to true the extreme hatred of html on tech lists strikes me as umm extreme so i guess i ll have to retrain it yes you told me so that would be a different experiment i m certainly curious to see whether jeremy s much worse than mine error rates are typical or aberrant
