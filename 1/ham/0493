 jim whitehead writes the cd player we have combines play and pause in a single button but doesn t provide instantaneous feedback that the button was pushed instead requiring you to wait until the music starts seconds this is a ui disaster since tatum doesn t get feedback right away she presses the button again thereby pausing the cd before it even plays she ll only ever get music if she presses the button an odd number of times this happens a surprising amount of the time since she eventually hits the button again when the music doesn t play nice to hear that somebody else does this too karl anderson kra monkey org http www monkey org kra
