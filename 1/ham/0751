 original message from r a hettinga seriously look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity of this continent before the europeans got here look at it now even for descendants of the original inhabitants even for the descendents of slaves who were brought here by force i wouldn t say that the societies of humans here before european occupancy was lifted by free xyz perhaps replaced or sunk or some other description but not lifted also the lifestyle of the remnants of those societies is on average only marginally above poverty even today
