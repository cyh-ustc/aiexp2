 i like this part sounds like httpd on the client http www openp p com pub a p p xdegrees html once the client component is installed a server can order a program to run on the client any cgi script java servlet asp component etc could be run on the client this is like breaking the web server into two parts originally web servers just understood http and sent pages then the field started demanding more from the web and the servers got loaded down with cgi and mod perl and active pages and stuff so now the web server can choose to go back to simple serving and where the application is appropriate let the client do the other razzamatazz this is superior to javascript in one important detail the program doesn t have to reload when a new page is loaded as javascript functions do and because xdegrees uses web compatible technology users can access xdegrees resources without installing any software simply by using their browser scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a new naming and searching system ceo michael tanne claims to have figured out mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and billions of resources scaling is facilitated by the careful location of servers xdegrees will colocate servers at key routing points as akamai does and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default home server enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in house applications files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the internet as with napster or freenet in fact the caching in xdegrees is more sophisticated than it is on those systems users with high bandwidth connections can download portions or stripes of a file from several cached locations simultaneously the xdegrees software then reassembles these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that the downloaded file is the same as the original a key component of this digital signature is a digest of the file which is stored as an http header for the file
