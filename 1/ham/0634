 if the text recognition algorithm architecture humans use is anything like the algorithm structure we ve been working with the reason the first letter and to a lesser extent the last letter is important is that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially more difficult from a theoretical standpoint anyway and has to be resolved using deeper abstraction analysis the middle letters are far less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly i think keeping the number of middle letters consistent with the correct spelling is important would be interesting to see if this same effect is applicable to written forms of other languages maybe even japanese romongi bill
