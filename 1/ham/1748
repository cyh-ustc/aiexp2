 your mail and gives you only the non spam to train it you d only need to send it the false negatives somehow it can assume that anything is ham that you don t say is spam within hours i have folks who leave their email programs running hours a day constantly polling for mail if they go away for a long weekend lots of friday night spam will become ham on sunday night friday night seems to be the most popular time so we ll make this a config parameter your idea here ultimately i d like to see tight integration into the most popular email clients as a stop gap to the auto ham what s an auto ham how about adding an imap server with a spam and deleted ham folder most email clients can handle imap users should be able to quickly move spam into the spam folder i personally don t think imap has a bright future but for people who do use it that s certainly a good approach instead of deleting messages or by reprogramming the delete function they can quickly move ham into the ham folder yes guido van rossum home page http www python org guido
