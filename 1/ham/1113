 both move and link are one click actions on a folder label move s the current message on a folder label link s the current message robert elz said date thu sep from hal devore message id right click on the folder label in the folder list that the way i have it configured and it sounds as if the way tony does too just does a move rather than select as target without moving of course if you can manage to get no messages currently selected then it works fine in the main window the key puts you into a change folder mode the first time you use it after starting exmh hit a second and you go to set a target mode type a few characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete this works but is not nice if you re not using the keyboard but just the mouse tony i agree a nice way to link in one click would be good and should be easy to add though currently adding mouse bindings something like shift right click would be a good choice is much harder than adding key bindings but note there s no need to undo the way i generally use link if the desired destination folder isn t the current selected target is to right click on the target which selects it and moves the message and because i have the automatic move to the next message on move or link option set select the message again and then link exmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at a time that is one of delete move or link selecting any of those implicitly undoes any previous choice from the three so you cannot achieve a move by doing a link then delete then commit it needs to be link commit delete commit xmh was just the same there incidentally how s spring shaping up down under no meaningful comment from me i m not there at the minute but i m told that where i m from it is cold wet and miserable though has been better during the day sunny days cold nights for the past few in any case all of that is a good enough reason to stay away kre exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users brent welch software architect panasas inc pioneering the world s most scalable and agile storage network www panasas com welch panasas com exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
