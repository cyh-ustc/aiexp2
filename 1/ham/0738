 weird i never thought the govmint would get into funding this you know weapons of mass destruction etc etc http dc internet com news article php september senate committee passes nanotech bill by roy mark the senate commerce committee unanimously passed on thursday legislation to promote nanotechnology research and development introduced by sen ron wyden d ore the st century nanotechnology research and development act would create the national nanotechnology research program the bill is co sponsored by sen joe lieberman d conn and sen george allen r va the proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would support long term nanoscale research and development and promote effective education and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers and professionals the unanimous support of the senate commerce committee is a very big step forward for this very small technology lieberman who vowed to pushed to full senate passage before the end of the year said nowhere in the world are the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of nanotechnology the u s certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to lead the world in developing this technology our legislation will provide the nation with a long term focus and sustained commitment and facilitate new collaborations between government academia and industry that will ensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation the bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology program under the national science and technology council it would also create a presidential national nanotechnology advisory panel and national nanotechnology coordination office which would provide administrative and technical support for the advisory panel and the council my own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to change america on a scale equal to if not greater than the computer revolution i am determined that the united states will not miss but will mine the opportunities of nanotechnology wyden said in introducing the bill at present efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a half dozen federal agencies i want america to marshal its various nanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world s leader in this burgeoning field and i believe federal support is essential to achieving that goal to study the potential long term effects of nanotechnology a new center for societal ethical educational legal and workforce issues related to nanotechnology would also be established according to lieberman the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the national research council nrc which completed a thorough review of the national nanotechnology initiative in june those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel emphasizing long term goals striking a balance between long term and short term research supporting the development of research facilities equipment and instrumentation creating special funding to support research that falls in the breach between agency missions and programs promoting interdisciplinary research and research groups facilitating technology transition and outreach to industry conducting studies on the societal implications of nanotechnology including those related to ethical educational legal and workforce issues and the development of metrics for measuring progress toward program goals
