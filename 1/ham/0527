 on fri sep russell turpin wrote you seem not to know what a poor man s divorce is i know very little in general i hope you can excuse me for that it is an old term from the time when divorce was difficult but walking was easy and identity was not so locked down as it is today not every widow had a dead husband yeah you could always run away strangle your wife your wife could always poison you scooby dooby doo it wasn t the rule and i don t feel like desintegrating into a nitpicking orgy you win i m seeing lack of innovation that doesn t tell us anything except what is happening in eugen leitl s life the more common yeah i happen to live in a small hole under the roots of an old oak tree you don t so innovation is a global phenomenon observation is that the rate of change is increasing do you have any data that might persuade us that what you see is more telling than what others see gerontocracy favors gerontocracy i would have thought that gerontocracy favors biotech research and plenty of young workers to pay taxes so thought i but apparently all it favours is a lot of whining about good old times the inability of youngn s to pay for your pension and the health insurance and the generic influx of uncouth furriners which must be stopped somehow note that the fertility rate doesn t result from decisions made by the old but by the young if we uh i m kinda aware of that want more kids we have to convince people who are in their twenties to become parents now we re talking got a plan
