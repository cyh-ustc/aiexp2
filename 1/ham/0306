 hello again i tried all the suggestions for the pctel driver and at the end of it everything still goes smoothly until i type make after i get the output from the configure however there were a couple of things i noticed along the way after typing cp configs kernel config config make oldconfig make dep the nd to last line i got back said that the modversions h file was not updated when i looked at this path to the modversions h file it was lines and every line started with a mark is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a mark or am i just thinking of another language and so should i delete the at certain places also when i was in the pctel directory and typed make i noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions h file inside this other file there s nothing at all and so i moved the modversions h file with lines to the empty modversions h file and got a different reply after make the output after i moved the file over mostly looked like this usr src linux linux modversions h linux modules adb ver no such file or directory usr src linux linux modversions h linux modules af ax ver no such file or directory usr src linux linux modversions h linux modules af ipx ver no such file or directory the odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what s written after the in the modversions h file should there be a file at each of these one at each of the lines of the file that i d have to compile make it s taken plenty of elbow grease but i m glad it hasn t gone smoothly it s a good learning experience again any help is appreciated thanks eric email services provided by trackbike com your source for alleycat and trackbike photos submissions welcome promote your group and strengthen ties to your members with email yourgroup org by everyone net http www everyone net btn tag irish linux users group ilug linux ie http www linux ie mailman listinfo ilug for un subscription information list maintainer listmaster linux ie
