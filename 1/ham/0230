 just as the pyramids of egypt were built in honour of great kings it was fitting that sandy replicas were created on weymouth beach in memory of the king of the castle fred darrington who became the world s most famous sand sculptor died last week aged his grandson mark anderson who has taken over his dorset seafront pitch is determined that his grandfather s name will not be forgotten despite the impermanence of his creations can someone please tell me what a pitch constitutes i have an idea it is somewhat like the spots street musicians claim but this sounds more formal just an area of the beach by the prom where he s allowed to make his sculptures weymouth is where i spent my teenage years my mum and one sister still live there so i m pretty familiar with the sculptures pretty impressive and very big i think he uses some sort of armature for some bits it s not just sand they usually get vandalised though after a lot of drinks it obviously is a good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits then again weymouth is pretty run down and attracts holiday makers of the worst sort yahoo groups sponsor dvds free s p join now http us click yahoo com pt ybb nxieaa mvfiaa gsolb tm to unsubscribe from this group send an email to forteana unsubscribe egroups com your use of yahoo groups is subject to http docs yahoo com info terms
