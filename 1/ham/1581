 on mon sep justin mason wrote simon matthews said procmail is reliable as long as none of the recipies fails i was hoping to resolve the triplets txt problem and thus avoid the procmail rom problem i doubt it s related actually the triplets stuff is in a totally unrelated area of code the procmail bug happens when the filter program does something that procmail doesn t expect exactly what that something is hasn t been confirmed by anyone on the procmail list it might be exiting with a nonzero status or it might be producing output on the standard error or it might be something else entirely so simon is attempting to get sa to run flawlessly because then it can t tickle the procmail bug this isn t a fix it s a band aid but because he apparently doesn t have the option of installing a newer procmail
