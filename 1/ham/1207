 kevin oberman said it did for me but i am not willing to say it is not a tcl tk issue as other apps seemed to work ok for cut and paste and tk does its clipboard stuff a bit differently than most toolkits so i m not about to place blame just reporting my experience one more salvo on x and cut paste x specifies at least two mechanisms for cut paste but as usual mandates no policy windows and macintosh have a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy i m quite sure that tk implements all primary and clipboard selections accurately the primary selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection on your x display the clipboard selection is the one with the explicit copy step and is the same as what you have on windows and macintosh however exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism which is another archaic mechanism supported at one point perhaps still today by versions of emacs exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these mechanisms under one umbrella and by all reports it is not that great i would encourage folks to play with those lines of code in text selection and report what works well for them we may come up with lines that work for everyone or perhaps introduce yet another setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models of course that s an admission of policy failure but i m willing to do that brent welch software architect panasas inc pioneering the world s most scalable and agile storage network www panasas com welch panasas com exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
