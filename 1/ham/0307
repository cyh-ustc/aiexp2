 on thu sep at pm eric nichols wrote hello again i tried all the suggestions for the pctel driver and at the end of it everything still goes smoothly until i type make after i get the output from the configure however there were a couple of things i noticed along the way after typing cp configs kernel config config make oldconfig make dep the nd to last line i got back said that the modversions h file was not updated when i looked at this path to the modversions h file it was lines and every line started with a mark is it the case that nothing is read on a line after a mark or am i just thinking of another language and so should i delete the at certain places no that is appropriate content for the file i m not a c programmer but i think that these sort of things include are instructions to the compiler processed by a pre processor in the compile process and include all sorts of symbols functions e g include gives you maths type functions since they start with they are ignored in the final compilation regarding the rest of the compile process you need to tell the pctel software to look in the right place for the kernel headers source i recall from your previous mail that there was a flag with kernel includes usr src linux which could be passed to the configure script with the appropriate directory in place of usr src linux this might allow you to persuade the code to compile against the correct headers i think this is the right way to proceed alternatively maybe the steps above regarding make dep and so forth should have been performed in the directory where the make process is looking for modversions h co i don t think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as you describe below first of all you will move modversions h which you have done then you would have to move all those ver files after that there will almost certainly be a need for further header h files this could be quickly done but is probably bad those files don t really belong there for what it s worth i think you are very close to a successful compilation m also when i was in the pctel directory and typed make i noticed that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions h file inside this other file there s nothing at all and so i moved the modversions h file with lines to the empty modversions h file and got a different reply after make the output after i moved the file over mostly looked like this usr src linux linux modversions h linux modules adb ver no such file or directory usr src linux linux modversions h linux modules af ax ver no such file or directory usr src linux linux modversions h linux modules af ipx ver no such file or directory the odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what s written after the in the modversions h file should there be a file at each of these one at each of the lines of the file that i d have to compile make michael conry ph web http www acronymchile com key fingerprint b c a cb b de c irish linux users group ilug linux ie http www linux ie mailman listinfo ilug for un subscription information list maintainer listmaster linux ie
