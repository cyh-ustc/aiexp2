 once upon a time mark wrote i remember apt get dist upgrading from to fine so it should work maybe i ve done that too on many production servers the only little unimportant catch is to replace kernel headers by glibc kernheaders a simple apt get install glibc kernheaders taking care of that upgrading between releases is meant to work not between betas or beta and releases the reason is simple some packages may have been downgraded some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different dependencies for both these categories of packages the upgrade through apt rhn whatever just won t do as some older packages might be considered as the newest thus being kept on the system as red hat does i really don t recommend trying to upgrade between betas or from a beta to a final release either simply backup your home etc and root and or usr local if needed then reinstall cleanly it ll probably save a few hassles and you ll get the cleanest possible system matthias matthias saou world trade center edificio norte planta system and network engineer barcelona spain electronic group interactive phone rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
