 dag but when procmail runs it it doesn t presumably as it dag doesn t have the authorization to communicate with the dag laptop beeing another user i don t know anything about the kde sound server but i d guess your problem is the environment in which procmail runs you don t say what procmail is running from in my case for example procmail is run from fetchmail which is run by a cron job sorry about that procmail is run by the qmail delivery agent to presort all mail i get but anyway i found an error message in procmail log which solved the problem the following line in my delivery script seems to work fine now display artsplay btw if you use exmhwrapper found in the misc directory you can generalize this to display cat home exmh display artsplay yes but that probably means that you have to have exmh running on the laptop to get the notification with exmh getting upset by two instances running at the same time this creates the problem that i cannot run to the closest compter to check out the new mail but thanks for the hint i might use that for some other hack brgds dag exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
