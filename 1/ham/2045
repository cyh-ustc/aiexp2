 url http www mozillazine org weblogs hyatt date not supplied i received some feedback in email from several of you actually regarding my earlier blog about the parents television council which recently published a report in which they labeled buffy as the worst show on television for children let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under and a game like gta is as well the ptc however has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games there is a belief on the part of the ptc that the hour from pm the first hour of primetime must be designated a family hour and that no offensive shows should air during that time i don t believe that it s the networks responsibility to restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television the shows that air during primetime run the gamut some are family oriented and some aren t there is however no shortage of suitable content should parents and children wish to watch tv together during this hour it should be the parent s responsibility to police a child s television viewing if you don t want your kids watching buffy the vampire slayer then don t let them but don t campaign to have the show removed from the air or shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because you don t like its content if you don t think a show is appropriate don t let your kids watch it the ptc also seems to find shows offensive that are family oriented an example of one such show is malcolm in the middle i would hardly call this show inappropriate for kids apparently the only shows that the ptc deems appropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their ultra conservative agenda even then i wouldn t really mind but the idea that all other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous http www parentstv org
