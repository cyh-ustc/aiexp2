 owen byrne wrote what a load of crap politics are somehow more muddy now i d say that its considerably clearer the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised and the common practice of putting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from tv cameras visiting dignitaries etc further exacerbating those feelings unpeaceably disrupting political rallies is now usually done by police with riot gear and pepper spray we had a good one here a month or so ago a few people peaceably strayed from the permit area which was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance ministers held here the motorcade drove by it for about seconds and were immediately gassed beaten and arrested not very muddied at all what does that exactly have to do with the statement that distruption of peacable political assembly has become a common practice disruption tool it s an observation not a judgement comment approval you ve focused on the word muddy to use it in a different context than the one i posted maybe the distinction i was trying to make was too subtle and i was trying to be too clever with my writing this morning let me summarize the important parts of my post for you i have a premise that there is a difference between free and protected speech and action i think o neill on his soapbox doesn t understand the distinction all better greg
