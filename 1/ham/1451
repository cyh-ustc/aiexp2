 on wednesday august at am robin lynn frank wrote if i were a spammer i d simply set up a server send out my spam with the habeus headers and continue till i was reasonably certain i d been reported then i d simply reconfigure the server and reconnect to a different ip as long as no one can establish my connection to the web sites my spam is directing people to i m home free uh the reason is simple habeas runs something called the habeas infringers list and if you use their trademark without their permission you ll end up on it then when you send spam with the misappropriated header users of sa supports this will tag your mail as spam rather than let it through this may be done independantly of your ip address so be prepared to constantly change domain names and move your servers as fast as you send spam also that little haiku is a copyrighted work so not only can habeas sue they must sue to protect their copyright and since it s a trademark as well that s a double whammy habeas has some pretty high powered legal people who will gladly go to town on violators the whole point here is to give them the legal leverage they need to put spammers out of business and not only block mail from them but allow through the things that really aren t spam b this sf net email is sponsored by jabber the world s fastest growing real time communications platform don t just im build it in http www jabber com osdn xim spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk lists sourceforge net https lists sourceforge net lists listinfo spamassassin talk
