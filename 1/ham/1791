 there seem to be two drivers for the classifier now neale pickett s hammie py and the original gbayes py according to the readme txt gbayes py hasn t been kept up to date is there anything in there that isn t covered by hammie py about the only useful feature of gbayes py that hammie py doesn t yet copy is u which calculates spamness for an entire mailbox this feature can easily be copied into hammie py gbayes py also has a large collection of tokenizers but timtoken py rules so i m not sure how interesting that is now therefore i propose to nuke gbayes py after adding a u feature anyone against i imagine that skip or barry might have a stake in gbayes py tim seems to have moved all code he s working to other modules guido van rossum home page http www python org guido
