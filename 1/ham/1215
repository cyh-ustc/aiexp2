 how easy would it be to code a menu item that marks as read all messages before the current message i often have problems reading heavy traffic mailing lists in exmh because i want to read only a subset of a lists messages but i lose track of where i was in the particular folder this could also be coded more generally in the new sequences code as a way to remove all messages before current from a particular sequence easy first you ll have to excuse me as i m still using so this may not play well with recent changes i did look at too and i just did this off the top of my head i wanted to see if it still worked so this is somewhat untested adding a menu entry is trivial add this to your exmh exmh defaults fops more m uentrylist ketchup fops more m l ketchup catch up all b cur fops more m c ketchup my mark curseen then you just need to provide the source for my mark curseen and arrange for exmh to include it put it in your tk exmh directory in your user tcl or in pick patch if you enable the source hook under prefs hacking support it s going to look something like this proc my mark curseen global exmh pick msg exmh status clearing unseen up to cur red mh setcur exmh folder msg id set pick ids get message ids for pick cur busy pickmarkseen exmh status ok blue that s based upon the guts of pick markseen you need to fill in the code for the get section i ran out of time john it just works tm it my head exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
