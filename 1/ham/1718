 i am somewhat puzzled by a phone call i or rather the cio at the isp for whom i work received from an individual claiming to represent cloudmark the gist of the call was that since we were using razor and checking our mail against the razor servers and that since those servers contain information proprietary to cloudmark we would in the near future be required to begin paying cloudmark spamnet user per year i was wondering if anyone else has received such a call i am curious as to whether a spammer has begun to try contacting razor users with the above tactic in an effort to get them to stop using razor or whether the open source community aspect of the razor project is going by the wayside in lieu of a strictly commercial approach ala brightmail and the likes sven this sf net email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven http thinkgeek com sf razor users mailing list razor users lists sourceforge net https lists sourceforge net lists listinfo razor users
