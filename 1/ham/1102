 i ve never understood the mouse buffer operation with exmh either here s the behaviour i have i have exmh and xemacs windows up and a terminal window i also have gnome running and enlightenment as wm i select text in the exmh window and while it is highlighted i can paste into anything else if i select it and then click so the highlighting is off then what i paste is not the recently selected text in exmh but an old selection if i select in xemacs and leave it highlighted i can paste it into exmh sedit window but if it is no longer highlighted what i paste is an old selection i can live with this behaviour except for one additional thing if nothing is highlighted then what i paste into exmh is different from what i paste into other windows to be more specific here s what gets pasted if nothing is highlighted application what gets pasted xemacs whatever was last selected unless it was last selected in exmh xterm same as xemacs abiword nothing nedit nothing sedit whatever was last highlighted in sedit and overwritten the last needs some amplification if i highlight something in sedit then obviously that s what gets pasted if the highlighting is off then what gets pasted is not what was last highlighted in sedit but what was last highlighted and typed over i have type kills sel on it seems that exmh and sedit are the oddballs here very often when i try to paste something in sedit i end up muttering wtf rick exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
