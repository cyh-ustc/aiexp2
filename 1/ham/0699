 this is for those that have interacted with d winer dave s idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around you re supposed to just shut up and take it http winerlog inspiredsites net who s the real monster it seems good ol uncle dave is once again trying to savage anyone that dares to disagree with him it seems ben kevin and bill are making too strong a case so here we dave s attempt to fool you into thinking they re some sort of monsters violent ones no less anyone who works with hemenway or kearney should be aware that these people are nothing less than monsters who will stoop to any level to get their way yeah sure dave whatever you need to believe the truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and improving rss in general each with their own brand of attitude to be sure but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move forward how is that being monstrous is dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public s perception of them if you haven t already contact them and ask them how they feel about this foolishness am discuss dave deflects what he can t take the time to understand it s really quite pitiful when normal people don t understand something they usually try learning about it they read up ask questions and seek the help of those that understand it this before shooting their mouths off and looking like fools what dave does is just the opposite posts a link to something he doesn t understand get s a bunch of e mail from people who do understand it derides the idea as being too much trouble and blogs it expects others to do research for him abuses anyone who tries to help him pontificates incorrectly about only part of the issue realizes he s been a fool but refuses to correct himself plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy tries making the educated people look like fools sends private e mails to them trying to scare them off exposes any private e mail they write out of context deflects and runs off to some new topic repeats from his continued diatribes about rss and it s use of rdf reveal this to be true dave doesn t get the idea of the semantic web he d rather have you follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth trying one reader wrote to us with a good analogy it s like that movie the poseidon adventure dave s like the purser ranting and raving that the passengers should follow him and march toward the bow i don t know about you but i d rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room the ship s fucking sinking and i don t want to be following the idiot dave s idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around you re supposed to just shut up and take it after all why would good ol uncle dave want to hurt you it s all about love right to hell with asking you if you want to get shafted and if you dare complain he savages you then he tries to make everyone think you re the one causing all the trouble we ve news for you dave we re wise to your tactics and we re talking amongst ourselves about it we re routing around you damaging behavoir that s where we re coming from if you have an example of how you ve tried to help dave please drop us an e mail about it we ll keep it strictly confidential of course send it along to zaphod egroups com am discuss trying to talk with dave is like trying to wrestle a pig the trouble is you get dirty and the pig seems to like it another developer tries talking to dave and discovers it s fundamentally impossible his basic response was just that rdf was a joke and the semantic web developers are doing a terrible job in the span of less than five minutes dave makes such an ass of himself that people at other tables start whispering that guy is an idiot the zaphodim however are veteran pig wrestlers if you ve got a similar tale from the mud pit be sure to drop us a line at zaphod egroups com pm discuss response aha some backing down by the whining one it would appear the dictator release strategy that dave s been trying on his crappy little set of rss hacks is failing to gain support i m going to push back the caveat removing on the spec by hours still have work to do on the sample file i want to look into the rfc for time date specs and get started on the radio implementation of i have to prepare for seybold tomorrow and i want to a little memorial for a busy few days for a guy still recovering also it would be great if people who make content tools could review the spec and see if there are any deal stoppers hell yeah there are deal stoppers like nobody wants it nor will they use it the poor radio customers the poor salon blog users they re going to be dragged unwillingly into producing xml content that nobody will use so with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch dave is going to turn all their content into totally unsupported garbage ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start getting rejected of course at the same time dave tries to play the sympathy card what utter fucking nonsense this past weekend the blogosphere excoriates him for his blame america bullshit then the rss community tells him to get stuffed with his dictator release of rss now he s trying to pretend we should be nice to him because he s still recovering uh dave if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking fights we ll still kick your ass regardless that s what years of your abusing people has gotten you dave no sympathy anymore none whatsoever pm discuss dave is scary on posted on scripting news on note during the day tomorrow there will be no updates to scripting news i ll be in sf at seybold leading a discussion on web services for publishing with people from amazon apple google and jake savin of userland i may be able to update my radio weblog but only if there s something really important to report so best wishes for a happy and safe what kind of asshole wishes people a happy obviously someone who doesn t have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy am discuss yeow and we though we were harsh wow apparently dave s sticking his neck out quite far these days craig schamp practically keel hauls him with this one he wraps it up with the man seems to show over and over that he s nothing more than a whining buffoon give that man an honorary zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring related links over at photodude richard bennett andrea harris reid stott jeff jarvis ipse dixit and the fat guy pm discuss rss code name hitler if dave tries to steamroll rss through without formal community consensus here now we call it the hitler release of no objections no he means no objections i choose to hear dave is simply not listening people are objecting all over am discuss referral log funnies every now and then we check the referral logs to see what s pointing back to us we sincerely apologize to the pool soul that used this search pm discuss luserland attempts to trademark rss dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any bigco that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally bankrupt scripting news is full of examples so we found it surprising as did many others when luserland software tried to patent the term rss back in here s the patent application http tarr uspto gov servlet tarr regser serial entry this was apparently just between the start of the rss development efforts and the publication of the specification winer knew about the rss stuff indeed he complained about it bitterly at the time could dave be any more transparent since when has dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others to do a good quote from before he filed the patent application tim o reilly says patents are ok he s just against stupid patents in the spirit of touch of grey tim man patents are lock in of the worst kind there s no way to route around them am discuss when s a permalink not a permalink when dave writes an item then removes it the permalink links to nothing at that point so apparently the perma part in permalink is permanent for everyone except dave too bad his little attempt at a definition fails to mention this pm discuss
