 kenneth nerhood said i too am seeing very weird things with and awl i installed a fresh system and then ran a bunch of test spam through it all from the same user all messages should have scored over the awl kept adjusting them down so that after about message i had a negative score i m using spamc d that s exactly what is intended the idea is that legit senders who habitually score just will eventually get out of awl hell after messages note that running a single spam through spamassassin a t will eventually whitelist the spammer but that s why the man page tells you not to do it j this sf net email is sponsored by thinkgeek welcome to geek heaven http thinkgeek com sf spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk lists sourceforge net https lists sourceforge net lists listinfo spamassassin talk
