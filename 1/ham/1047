 well i ve used the check the modify time cache trick for files in many places not just exmh so some part of me certainly thinks it is effective however it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint state then aren t we modifying the sequences file for the current folder on every message read perhaps we look at the sequences file more than once per message view just idle speculation we can stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log we could make that conditional on some support available in tcl has had clock seconds like gettimeofday and clock clicks high resolution timer for some time but in we ve calibrated clock clicks values to microseconds it is still only useful for relative times but each call to exmh log could emit the microsecond delta since the last log record of course we are measuring all the overhead of taking the log record etc i ll try it out chris garrigues said from brent welch date wed aug robert elz said mh sequence also goes and rereads the files mh sequences and the context file but i m not sure how frequently that one is called in some places i maintain caches of files by checking their modify time but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to check their date stamp you could just read them again do you really think this is true i added a modify time check thinking that it would make an improvement since we were reading it a lot more times in the new code because we re trying to use the sequences on the other hand the sequences files are probably being read out of cache when that happens anyway even with a small file i d think that the time taken to do a file mtime filename would be worth it my code is in proc mhreadseqs chris chris garrigues http www deepeddy com cwg vircio http www vircio com congress suite austin tx world war iii the wrong doers vs the evil doers brent welch software architect panasas inc pioneering the world s most scalable and agile storage network www panasas com welch panasas com exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
