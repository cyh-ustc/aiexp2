 gary lawrence murphy ok but only if you also meant religious and alcoholic extremes since it was my quip i ll point out that i used the term alcoholism implying addiction i drink i m not an alcoholic most people who drink don t go to aa meetings most people who go to aa meetings do try very hard not to drink as to religion i think it is harmful and risky in almost any degree were i single i might consider potential mates who partook of the less irrational or more light hearted religions a unitarian or buddhist might be an example of the first a wiccan of the second but someone who is both irrational and serious about that irrationality strikes me as a bad choice of partner moreso than someone who was addicted to some drug alcoholics and drug addicts at least have the sense to battle their problem and to keep their children from suffering it the religious revel in their irrationality and want to raise their children in it that s a difficult difference for two parents to reconcile fortunately i am long and happily enamored of someone who has no religious tendencies send and receive hotmail on your mobile device http mobile msn com
