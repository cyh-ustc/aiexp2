 jm jmason org justin mason writes folks who ve been hacking on the dnsbls would it be worthwhile commenting this in head seeing as it only gets anyway sounds like the a broken server and b low hitrate combine to make it not so useful imo no in my opinion it s purely a bug in sa or the libraries we use which is the same thing that we don t handle outages of network services better the rule is useful and it does help reduce spam we should keep it i have a feeling the dnsbl rules will cluster a bit more heavily around the to range once we start using the new ga on them also was a slightly conservative number since i didn t have real time data i typically used the lower or median number of different periods most recent month two months six months depending on the trend of the period data better performance for recent messages favor recent scores worse performance for recent messages favor lowest scores never pick the highest number unless the rule was very accurate and the highest number was for the most recent data dan
