 hi all i ve decided at last to test the alsa sound drivers as usual the result is that i ve spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality people seem to think it outputs but hey some of you will benefit from that right i ve got the whole thing working on a valhalla system but the packages should easily install or at least recompile on enigma limbo null and maybe others who knows here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out recompile the alsa driver source rpm for your running kernel you can install the binary package if you re using the i install this alsa driver package install the alsa libs package install the alsa utils package now go to this url and find out what you need to change in your etc modules conf file to replace the default oss driver loading http www alsa project org alsa doc very complete and very good documentation hopefully you ll see that your card is supported reboot or remove by hand your current sound modules you ll probably need to stop many applications to free the sound resource by hand and insert the new ones if all is well you ve got alsa working dmesg to check is a good idea you now just need to adjust the volume levels with e g aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default with aplay you can already test files to see if you hear anything you can also install the xmms plugin seems to make my xmms segfault on exit hmmm but maybe it s another plugin to listen to your good ol mp files that s it it really isn t complicated and has never been from what i see the only thing i disliked was to have to install from source but as i can t imagine myself doing that i ve repackaged everything cleanly even the dev entries are included in the rpm package and not created by an ugly post script i insist and seamlessly integrate into the etc makedev d structure there are also a few other noticeable differences with the default provided alsa spec files for example i ve split alsa lib s development files into an alsa lib devel package and included static libraries there are others of course oh yes the kernel version against which the alsa driver package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the rpm release so does the architecture i m open to any comments or suggestions about these packages download http ftp freshrpms net pub freshrpms testing alsa current spec files http freshrpms net builds alsa driver alsa driver spec http freshrpms net builds alsa lib alsa lib spec http freshrpms net builds alsa utils alsa utils spec all others patches etc http freshrpms net builds matthias ps as an extra bonus i ve also recompiled xine with alsa support simply run xine a alsa and off you go it may even support and s pdif clean custom red hat linux rpm packages http freshrpms net red hat linux release valhalla running linux kernel load ac on line battery charging rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
