 now to do this we all know they have to be cracking the strong crypto used on all transaction in order to process them so this has some preaty heavy implications unless it s just bs anybody buying a box like this is undoubtledly going to integrate it into their crypto infrastructure what s the point of putting in a box like this if it s not an active participant in your security framework or you could just not bloat it x to begin with nah that was the whole point of xml afterall to sell more cpus much like oracle s use of java allows them to sell x more cpu licenses due to the performance hit blah blah blah the marketing fud gets compounded by the beberg fud talk about x bloat again see above they are claiming to decode the crypto what gives you the impression that s what they re doing that s not what the text says it s largely fluff anyway our xg execution core converts xml to machine code said kelly mmmmmmmmmmm machine code never a good idea uhhh fundamentally it s all machine code kelly s comment seems more like drivel from a clueless marketroid than anything of technical concern having what appears to be a silicon xml router would be a cool thing having one integrated with your crypto environment would kick ass let it deserialize decrypt repackage the xml before handing it off to the app servers the question of course is does it work with actual applications in the field without tremendously reworking them somehow i doubt it bill kearney
