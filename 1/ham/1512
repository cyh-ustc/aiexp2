 skip montanaro any thought to wrapping up your spam and ham test sets for inclusion w the spambayes project i gave it all the thought it deserved it would be wonderful to get several people cranking on the same test data and i m all in favor of that otoh my data subtree currently has more than files slobbering over million bytes even if i had a place to put that much stuff i m not sure my isp would let me email it in one msg apart from that there was a mistake very early on whose outcome was that this isn t the data i hoped i was using i hoped i was using a snapshot of only recent msgs to match the snapshot this way of only spam from but turns out they actually go back to the last millennium greg ward is currently capturing a stream coming into python org and i hope we can get a more modern and cleaner test set out of that but if that stream contains any private email it may not be ethically possible to make that available can you think of anyplace to get a large shareable ham sample apart from a public mailing list everyone s eager to share their spam but spam is so much alike in so many ways that s the easy half of the data collection problem
