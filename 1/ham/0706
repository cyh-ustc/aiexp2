 in a message dated am chuck topsail org writes that means you can t say anything may not be forked or printed or whatever you have the choice to ignore it that s not what the first amendment says at all it says that congress cannot say what can t be forked fork can establish any rules it wants similarly the new york times gets to choose what news it thinks is fit to print if the times chose not to print anything about say rosie o donnell it would be exercising its first amendment rights just as much as it would be if it chose to print something rosie o donnell doesn t like the necessary corollary of the freedom to say publish what one wants is the freedom to refuse to publish or say what one doesn t like the alternative is a state controlled press that reprints government press releases and calls them news the question of what is or is not forked is except for libel or other specific exceptions not a matter of law but a matter of what the publisher if any decides or the community if any negotiates or does as a matter of custom for my part i d rather people didn t use fork as a place in which to dump an expression of their political beliefs tom
