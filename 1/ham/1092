 on tue sep at robert elz wrote subject patch to complete a change i guess that most of us don t use link very often i noticed it last week but only got time to look and see why today i would like to use link a lot more but is it rather inconvenient i have set my right mouse button to move a message to another folder which works fine however link also uses the same destination folder as move and so if i want to use link i first have to mark the destination folder with a message move undo the move then i can use the link very inconvenient is there a better way for me to set this up so that link works with one or two simple clicks in essence is there a way to mark a destination folder for a message link or move without actually doing a move or link i couldn t see anything obvious cheers tony exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
