 on mon sep adam l beberg wrote battery pack huh what you dont use batteries for a mile run you use capacitors many times actually you use both the energy density and you can get the energy out fast enough note that no even best supercapacitors are a long way to go from reasonably good electrochemical energy sources but you can recharge and discharge them very quickly and they take lots more of cycles than the best battery ideal for absorbing the braking energy and turn them into smoking tires few moments or minutes afterwards the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run anyway just like a gas dragster is refueled so this wouldnt be cheating mph should be no problem i don t see any reason why evs shouldn t dominate dragster runs the traction is the limiting factor not motor power you can basically put the motors into wheelhubs mounted on a composite frame and dump juice into them until they melt which will be some sec downstream plenty of time to smoke anything of course it doesn t roar and spew smokage so it won t happen
