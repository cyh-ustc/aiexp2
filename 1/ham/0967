 i call pacbell sbc every two or three months about a recurring problem we have at my house we get a phone bill every month for someone who no longer lives at our house for a phone line which has been disconnected for over three years and the account balance is drum roll please sometimes the people i talk to cannot locate the account in their system and tell me that the phone number doesn t exist some people are able to locate the account but say that it has been disconnected and there is no way we could get a bill sent to us for that account some people can locate the account and verify that the line has been disconnected for three years and that the amount owed is and then they say somthing along the lines of huh or i m not sure what s going on hold please and eventually i have similar conversations with their managers and the account representatives and billing people and their managers and their managers managers ad naseum the outcome of every phone call is that they ll look into it and fix the problem and i might receive one or two more bills depending on when it s resolved so i wait a month or two and send the bills back marked not at this address please fsck off and then eventually call them back and go through the whole process again lately i just explain to the phone jockeys that i know it s not their fault and i m not mad at them and it s just not their day because i m about to give them hell then i give them the opportunity to have me yell at their boss which they seem all too happy to do at least it gives me a positive way to vent my aggressions and it s a lot cheaper than seeing a therapist perplexed elias bitbitch magnesium net wrote so i get a check from pac bell today sbc as they re called now turns out they went to the trouble of printing out signing sealing and stamping a check just to refund me for a whole
