 thx for the thoughts gentlemen yes as someone said i use terms loosely more than cool quality snobs only care about mpixels this is about communications the general public cares about speed not quality how is akamai doing these days not to mention any other qos businesses that come to mind implementation point about hooking to usb wires etc agree these implementations are super clunky attachable camera needs to be integrated a la nokia model basically useless until better handsets are released i think adoption ian brought up the fax problem brilliant thing is this is far more personal than faxes so can be justified more easily and marketed in family packs etc but yes the usual rules apply as mms phones have network efx content who cares about content that no one can think of useful content is always the business persons mistake the content is the users communications its anything and everything avg person could easily send half dozen pics to a dozen people a day mainly humorous i d guess who cares if content is trivial in nature picture speaks a thousand words display why are dig camera displays better than cell phones does anyone know who makes these small displays and what the trends are around them misc ramblings i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about hour photo processing trivial who needs it i get better resultion elswhere and yet it had great decentralizing impact the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation the digital camera and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion which will put the photo giants to bed and change the world in a meaningful way also sms didn t take off because its easy it took off because it costs less its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the profitabilty of their sms traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth in reality sms cannibilizes the voice rev s they bought their networks to handle ps it is relatively amusing that one low resolution complaint dropped just after joe watched a cartoon on his television you re right or at least i don t i saw an advert for it on tv last night can t miss futurama and i thought boy that s dumb if i wanted to share pictures with someone i d email them to them where they could see them on a x or x display instead of rob original message from eugen leitl mailto eugen leitl org sent monday august am to rob shavell cc fork example com subject re sprint delivers the next big thing on sun aug rob shavell wrote down in the tech world than mobile visual communications and yet no one seems to give much of a damn that right now that persons can take photos and share them instantly across space this is one of the biggest and the word trivial comes to mind last fundamental changes in human communications will be as big as the browser remote realtime streaming video is neat but sharing pictures you invoke big words rather readily http xent com mailman listinfo fork
