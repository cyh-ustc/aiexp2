 once upon a time ville wrote i assume that you won t ghost or remove these and the modules conf change on uninstall though so people who are installing this rpm and are unfortunate enough to have a dvd drive or just an ordinary cd non dvd drive that doesn t support dma will be left with a system without a working cd drive even after removing the rpm and without ever knowing what struck them you can t remove the dma setting from modules conf either unless you re sure that ogle added it there and nothing else needs it i ve never heard of any cd rom or dvd rom drive having problems with dma although there probably is since red hat decided to default disabling it a few releases back normally even if you try to enable dma and your device doesn t support it it simply don t be able to make the change and that s it the problem iirc is with crappy hardware that is supposed to support dma but doesn t work as expected when it s enabled maybe chris could confirm this i guess i ll settle for the dev dvd link change as described and putting the dma tip in the description matthias clean custom red hat linux rpm packages http freshrpms net red hat linux release valhalla running linux kernel acpi load rpm list mailing list http lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list
