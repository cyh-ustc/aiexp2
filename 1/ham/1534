 kerry nice said what about some reality check rules yeah you can pack in lots of things into the header to try and get some negative points but do they all make sense in combination can you have a pine message id in the same header with an outlook express one or a mutt user agent yes this is a big bonus of meta rules new in we can now e g check for an outlook style forwarded message and not give it negative points unless it contains other signs of being from outlook i think the headers should be paid special attention to the message content of something from the ny times or lockergnome might look spammy but usually they don t forge or fake anything in the header tone down the negative scores and ding them extra for any obvious forgeries when we get more good nice tests the ga will assign lower scores to them i think the current problem is that there are very few really good nice tests in the current rulebase and lots of ve tests that those newsletters hit giving the ga a big problem to solve j this sf net email is sponsored by osdn tired of that same old cell phone get a new here for free https www inphonic com r asp r sourceforge refcode vs spamassassin talk mailing list spamassassin talk lists sourceforge net https lists sourceforge net lists listinfo spamassassin talk
