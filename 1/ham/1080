 thanks brent now it s clearer to me what s needed i ve used the global sort and j c lawrence s re scan but there is still a vulnerability there if i have an instance of exmh running the folder i m visiting will have its new correct xmhcache overwritten with an incorrect one when i switch folders i can cron the sort and re scan process but i should kill running exmh s first best would be to have a button for global sort and update all scan caches in the exmh more menu rick brent brent welch wrote the following on tue sep brent there is an update all scan caches menu entry that rescans your brent folders similar to the short scripts folks have shared around it brent runs in the background exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
