 from stephen d williams mailto swilliams hpti com just to further weaken the food transaction argument i ll note that in my neighborhood the local mcdonalds won t even hand you your drink in the drive through until you fork over the cash maybe you never bought a hot dog from a street vendor and why is it that the margin of survival is so thin could it be that all of these tribal rivalries are part of what s holding back wholesale movement to the modern first world patterns of constructive thinking well yes but it doesn t change the idea that the margin of survival probably is that thin in this region i m sure that both sides were ready to be the agressor i m not i m sure both sides were equally ready to be the aggressor provided they were in a predominant position of power bush s reluctance to blast blind obeyance of religion as taught by your local madrassa or kkk leader apparently because he is fully involved with the general effort to expand unfettered religiosity as the solution to the world s ills is disappointing he has spoke against madrassa but what i heard sounded lame and carefully crafted to shield religion in general from scrutiny which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters the us is trying to avoid making war on the muslim religion us leadership remains reflexively multi cultural we all have disagreements but at some point it becomes a crime against humanity i didn t say burning the train was a good thing i said i understood it wasn t a spontaneous attack on people who had done no wrong
