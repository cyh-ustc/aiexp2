 tp tim peters writes tp jeremy hylton the total collections are messages i trained with messages tp i m reading this now as that you trained on about spam and tp about ham that s less than of the sizes of the tp training sets i ve been using please try an experiment train tp on of each and test once against the other of each this helps a lot here are results with the stock tokenizer training on hams spams training on hams spams training on hams spams training on hams spams total false pos total false neg and results from the tokenizer that looks at all headers except date received and x from training on hams spams training on hams spams training on hams spams training on hams spams total false pos total false neg is it safe to conclude that avoiding any cleverness with headers is a good thing tp do that a few times making a random split each time it won t be tp long until you discover why directories of individual files are tp a lot easier to work e g random shuffle makes this kind tp of thing trivial for me you haven t looked at mboxtest py have you i m using random shuffle too you don t need to have many files to make an arbitrary selection of messages from an mbox i ll report some more results when they re done jeremy
