 gary lawrence murphy said s stephen d williams writes s a which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its s past certainly not christianity islam etc rastafari that is if you concede that of the two founding branches only the one founded by the nyabingi were legit and the others were thinly veneered anti colonial hooligans there is also vietnamese buddhism unless you count setting fire to oneself as a foul action what about tibetan buddhism btw they seem like an awfully nice bunch of chaps and chapesses when we launched the native net in one of the first things we noticed on networking aboriginal groups around the world is that the british army with the us army as a proxy by extension were the common thread where neither was present physically or through influence there tended to be less violence the issue in ireland is complex but rest assured that religious aspects are only a co incidence of the invader colonials being predominantly members of the royal headed anglicans and the aboriginal population being predominantly members of the pope headed catholics the conflict itself has nothing to do with ideology or practice since the anglican church is a near identical clone of catholicism now i bet that s going to attract some healthy debate man i m not going there again i ll agree though that the ideology or practices of the religions have very little to do with the conflict the same is true of street gangs when people are disenfranchised it s easier to offer them the triad as a new family you get cellphones cars a dry place to live triad biker gangs mafia the ira al queda we ve been fighting the war on terrorism for as long as there s been commerce so you d think we d realize that escalation of violence is not a solution well said j
