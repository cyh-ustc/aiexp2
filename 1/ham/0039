 just got this i was just reading mail but in a very dark room where the keyboard is illuminated mostly by the light from the laptop screen i think i put my fingers on the wrong keys i mostly use the keyboard exclusively while running exmh this is from today s cvs the fixes for the problems i mentioned yesterday are included i eventually managed to contact the cvs server expected integer but got while executing incr m procedure mhseqexpand line invoked from within mhseqexpand folder msgids procedure mhseq line invoked from within mhseq folder seq how oldmsgids msgids procedure mh sequenceupdate line invoked from within mh sequenceupdate folder replace seq msgids procedure seq set line invoked from within seq set folder cur msgid procedure mh setcur line invoked from within mh setcur exmh folder msgid procedure msgchange line invoked from within msgchange noshow invoked from within time list msgchange msgid show procedure msg change line invoked from within msg change select sel noshow procedure selecttypein line invoked from within selecttypein mid right top msg command bound to event kre ps i have the sequences window vertical instead of horizontal and the colours from the ftoc stuff all deleted and it is looking just about as good as the old unseen window used to look i still have some work to do to make it a little nicer listboxes seem to have some strange habits and then i need to make it all optional and parameterized at the minute i m just embedding stuff in the code much quicker for prototyping once its done i ll send a patch for someone to look over exmh workers mailing list exmh workers redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh workers
