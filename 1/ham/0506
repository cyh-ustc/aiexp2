 hello adam thursday september pm you wrote alb so you re saying that product bundling works good point sometimes i wish i was still in ca you deserve a good beating every so often anyone else want to do the honors alb and how is this any different from normal marriage exactly other then alb that the woman not only gets a man but one in a country where both she and alb her offspring will have actual opportunities oh and the lack of alb de feminized over sized self centered mercenary minded choices mmkay for the nth time adam we don t live in the land of adam fantasy women actually are allowed to do things productive independent and entirely free of their male counterparts they aren t forced to cook and clean and merely be sexual vessels sometimes and this will come as a shock to you no doubt men and women even find love which is the crucial distinction between this system and they marry one another for the satisfaction of being together i know far fetched and idealistically crazy as it is but such things do happen i can guarantee you if my mother was approached by my father and years ago he commented on her cleaning ability as a motivator for marrying her we would not be having this conversation now if guys still have silly antequated ideas about women s role then their opportunities for finding women will be scarce again these situations are great provided everyone is aware that the relationship is a contractual one he wants a maid a dog and a prostitute he doesn t have to pay and she wants a country that isn t impoverished and teeming with aids a contract versus a true love interest marriage egh i really need to stop analyzing your posts to this extent i blame law school and my cat bb alb adam l duncan beberg alb http www mithral com beberg alb beberg mithral com best regards bitbitch mailto bitbitch magnesium net
