 the only way to insure a safe key is to use all the storage space in the universe too big to decrypt my point is there will never be a safe key what i would consider is how long does the data need to be protected if you need to protect the data for longer than months do not release it to the public if you are trying to stop the general public your customer from coping the data then use what is available on the market if you want to stop the bootleggers do not release the data to the public i have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked the act of unlocking the key gives away it s secret the tougher the lock the more pissed off your customers will be take ms xp for example only the home user is forced to register think of the nightmare if business had to register every copy how many times have we needed to reinstall our laptop os notice the amount of mac s sold after the xp release these where mostly home users that converted to mac os the new audio cd s that have digital copy protection so not play on my computer does this stop me from copying the cd no however it does make me return them and get my money back the more popular the software the more likely it is to be cracked jef
