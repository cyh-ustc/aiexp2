 in article you write patrick salsbury writes patrick one of the features i really like about exmh is the patrick ability to see which folders have unseen messages in patrick them but recently it seems to have vanished into the patrick bowels of my window manager in a place i can t get patrick to it claims to be running but doesn t appear patrick anywhere onscreen i m using enlightenment with a x patrick virtual desktop i ve tried dropping it to only patrick screen no help patrick this may not help work but i ve discovered recently that alt middle mouse pops up a list of all of my windows if i leave my mouse on the background it lists alt middle mouse as display task list menu hth bill when i do that it just moves my mouse to the very edge of a window probably trying to center it on the off screen window in question i ll have to try it with another window manager and see if i can get exmh to put it back inside of sane boundaries i don t have this problem with any other windows though just the exmhunseen window pat exmh users mailing list exmh users redhat com https listman redhat com mailman listinfo exmh users
